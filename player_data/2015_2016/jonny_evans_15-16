One of the missing threads for new season.......on purpose? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Did very well against the best Central American team, hopefully continues in that vein.

2~~~
I dread what this thread will turn into. I find opinions on him on here totally ridiculous and over the top. 

He was fine the other night and I hope we keep him.

3~~~
Agreed.

4~~~
the last two games should win him back some credits.  hope it's not too late

5~~~
Probably our best center back in these 2 games so far... The thing is though, how long until he gets injured? Because that's what has held him back IMO so I highly doubt that will change if it hasn't changed by the age of 28.

6~~~
Hope he stays and does well just for the haters to eat their words.Never been among my favourite players but some of the hates are ridiculous.

7~~~
Nice to see some positive comments in here for once. Has done well and as said above, would be great to give it to his haters.

8~~~
If we don't get a quality defender, he should start next to smalling.

9~~~
I was surprised Paddy got the nod over him in that second 11, guess he's almost certain to move so maybe that is the reasoning.

10~~~
Not being involved hints at another injury or his exit. Even Blind is ahead of him on the tour.

11~~~
I'd like him to stay.

12~~~
I would think that is exactly the reasoning myself.

13~~~
Rumours floating about that we have entered the race for Stones, maybe Evans is part of that? Who knows.

14~~~
Just rumours but that would be a cracking deal if we could pull that off. Hopefully if we do sign a new centre half this summer then that will pave the way for Evans to leave.

15~~~
Hopefully the latter, I think his time at United has run it's course and the recent Everton rumour was widely covered which felt like a briefing.

16~~~

17~~~
I like him a lot but I think he'll go. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

18~~~
I'd like him to leave. Take the £8m and run.

19~~~
Unless we sign another defender i can't see him being sold. Would be risky going into the season with only 4 centre backs one of which is cover for Shaw also with our record with defensive injuries.

I hope we do sign another defender though and Jonny moves onto somewhere where he can get back to his best.

20~~~
'Sorry about asking Moyes not to tell you he agreed to leave halfway through his last season for you, here's Jonny Evans. No this is not a joke.'

21~~~
I think you're probably right on that time scale. I think Moyes used to renew his Everton contract around Nov-Dec every year, that season there were rumblings he wasn't renewing his contract and didn't even want to discuss it in November so he must have known he was getting the United job very early on.

Definitely well before the jackanory he and Fergie tells about the meeting to offer him the job in April anyway.

22~~~
Oh, I thought I read that he was given the nod then but told he couldn't tell anyone not even the owner of Everton which he agreed to do, because that would let the world know Fergie was leaving and Fergie of course didn't want the distraction. 

But then my memory is shit so maybe that was just speculation.

23~~~
Thats probably not too far from the truth mate. Just the infamous story where Fergie told Moyes he was the man and the blood drained from his face is said to have taken place in March/April but Moyes must have knew months before seeing as he wouldn't even discuss a new contract with Everton.

24~~~
With Ramos supposedly playing us for a new contract and being increasingly less likely to join, while we seemingly aren't interested in Otamendi, it's becoming increasingly likely Evans stays.

I'm opposed to that personally. He isn't nearly good enough and is shot for confidence. Now is the time to sell up. If he stays and we fail to bring in a new CB, I could see a scenario where two centre backs are needed, as I'm unconvinced Jones or Rojo will do enough to consolidate their positions at the club next season.

25~~~
It's not the time to sell up until we bring in a new CB. 

There will be a meltdown in here on Sep 1st if he's still at the club.

26~~~
He was rounding into decent form before the suspension.   Wouldn't be bothered if he stays.

27~~~
Evans' contract expires in June 2016. This will be the last window we would be able to get a fee for him unless he signs a new contract. So I still think he is sold this summer.

28~~~
Reckon we are just waiting on another senior center back to arrive before jettisoning him off to Everton. I read some Martinez quotes on their club twitter hinting about needing a center back in the transfer window and knowing how they like to do business late in the window and their budget, he ticks all the boxes.

29~~~
How much??!

Be lucky to get 5m for him.

30~~~
Since we may not purchase a new CB. Why isn't Evans in contention for the LCB role. Hardly ever hear him being mentioned by the boss. He looked decent in pre season. He's 2 footed surely he could be a possibility for even the bench. Yes I know 110 percent of the caf wants him sold but surely if we aren't buying a new CB we should play him. He's also an academy graduate. That means alot to me personally. One of our own.

31~~~
He has Blind and Rojo in front of him already. For Evans to climb into the LVG's hierarchy piramid is very, very, very difficult. I'd say 1% chance and thats me being generous.

32~~~
I guess he's been told he's off so he's not being picked because his head wouldn't be in the game and because it would mean not playing a player we plan on keeping. If we don't sign a CB by September 1st then it'd be more worthwhile playing him than it is now.

33~~~
If we don't sign another CB would we still sell him? That's my question. Having Blind Rojo and Blackett as left-sided CBs?

34~~~
He's like 6th choice. Even McNair was on the bench ahead of him. 

I guess he will be off. I wouldn't sell him unless we get a replscement. Rather have Evans than McNair, who still has a lot to learn and Blackett.

35~~~
Spitting on someone and getting 7 games ban at a crunch time for us might have something to do with LVG not liking him..

36~~~
Thought LVG defended him vigorously in a press conference.

37~~~
Fergie did that many times,  even though players never got a sniff after something like that..

38~~~
part of the Stones deal?

39~~~
but LVG isn't fergie is he?

40~~~
True that not even close..

41~~~
I feel like Evans is done here. If we do not find a buyer I think he will end up on loan like Cleverley did last year.

42~~~
Think he's already below McNair in the pecking order.Would still be useful for us in some occasions though if he stays.

43~~~
I reckon he's gone, it's a shame as we will be losing yet another player who came through the ranks.

44~~~
His career here is over and in truth , he played himself out of the club..But if we dont want him, surely we should sell, or we would lose out on a good fee, or end up with a Cleverely like situation.

45~~~
I don't know where to put it so I'll put it here but why isn't there a player performance thread for Javier Hernandez? Looks like he will get some game time this season

46~~~
Lot of people on the last page seem to think there is some sort of personal 'hate' campaign against Evans. Personally, I reckon negativity around him is more to do with the fact that he was truly shocking for the most part last season, and wasn;t particularly great the season before either. Anyway, that's just a hunch, could be wrong.

47~~~
Thought the same.

48~~~
Is Jonny still around?  I feel like he has been locked in a cupboard for the last 6 months.  Is he fit?

49~~~
Yes, based on the fact that LVG said we had no injuries last week..He played one game on tour and that was it..I think LVG wants to get rid, but needs to sign a defender for that to occur quickly...

50~~~
Fit but shit. Had high hopes for him and thought he would be a guaranteed starter for us in future but he didn't improve as much as I expected and don't see him being here much longer.

51~~~
I really hope we get rid of Evans, he seems to have consistently gone downhill for some time. (and of course sign a top defender)

52~~~
Yeah probably

53~~~
Me too, I thought he would do well under Van Gal.  He has just seemed to have lost his bottle and now shits himself whenever the ball is nearby.

54~~~
too expensive to keep as 7th choice centre back, or whatever he is now Blind is ahead of him too!

55~~~
He was fine up until 2 years ago

Still has a lot to offer. One of those who was hit hard by Fergies departure

He would be a steal for most pl clubs

56~~~
Not in the squad again yesterday, is he injured or simply lost his bench spot to McNair?

57~~~
The latter I reckon. Van Gaal only mentions Jones (and Rojo through match fitness) as being unavailable at the moment.

58~~~
I'm surprised he hasn't been sold already then as if he's behind McNair and Rojo who isn't even ready for the bench yet, then he must be on his way and we usually make it easy for our home made players to get their moves.

59~~~
Yeah, if we signed another Centre Half, he'll go I'm sure. That's probably looking unlikely so we may choose to keep him around another year as cover until his contract expires, or let him go in January if he hasn't featured too much, a bit like Fletcher.

That said, I still think there's a chance he might end up at Everton this window.

60~~~
He'll be on that short list for clubs who want to do last day business if things arent going well. He'll go on the final day of the window. Sunderland should try their luck. They love him up there. And he'd look like Jaap Stam compared to that lot.

61~~~
I reckon the draw at Stoke on New Years day was what sealed his fate, he got bullied and couldn't handle the conditions at all.

62~~~
I think the fact he's now behind McNair and can't make the bench with Jones and Rojo not even fit to be in the squad says his time is up. I wonder if West Brom might be one of the teams to go for him, they were rumoured before Everton I think.

63~~~
Why don't we sell him and get some money? We make a profit no matter how much we get for him since he is our academy player. I reckon we can squeeze £8-10m for him.

64~~~
We can..a British multiple time league winner that has played in the UCL.. thats would be a very good signing I think

65~~~
Not a chance. I assume the reason he's still here is that we can't get any interest because if his prohibitive salary. There's no way a club comes in, matches his £65k weekly salary and pays anything more than a few £m.

He'd be the highest earner at 50% of Premier League clubs (90% of La Liga/Bundesliga/Serie A) and wouldn't start for that other 50% (10%).

66~~~
Think he'll go to Everton if they lose Stones.

67~~~
Such a shame. Really thought he'd push on and be top class.

68~~~
<i><span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Evans and Valdes absent</b></span>
Man Utd v Club Brugge (Tuesday, 19:45 BST)
Neither goalkeeper <b>Victor Valdes</b> nor defender <b>Jonny Evans</b> were on show at United's Carrington training complex.

Valdes has no United future after refusing to play for the club's Under-21 side last season. But Evans - who has been linked with Everton this summer - was named in United's Champions League squad last week.
</i>
From BBC

69~~~
Club refusing to comment...

70~~~
He's gone obviously, but we need a replacement..one that stays fit at least and can deal with the physical side of the game too in England.

71~~~

72~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>..You probably must have been waiting to use that for a long time..<span style="color: #ffffff">and status qou arent underrated</span>

73~~~
Included in Stones deal..... would be awesome!

74~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Possibly. Sooner he moves on, the better for all involved.

Very underrated btw........Quo that is, not Evans

75~~~
He's been told he can leave according to Mitten.

76~~~
Mitten:

<i>"Such status, though, is unlikely to save Jonny Evans, who has been told he can leave United. It's a shame that a United-supporting youth team graduate, who is closing in on 200 first team appearances by the age of 27 has to leave, but that's the manager's decision and many fans will agree with it."</i>

77~~~
He's leaving because his perfomances havent been good enough..that isnt a shame...Getting rid of the dead wood will mean that they were will be many tears , but it has to be done..Darren Fletcher was my favourite United player over the last decade, but even he left when the time was right..Its time for Jonny too

78~~~
You're right, it is the right time.

79~~~
I don't think he can play the way Van Gaal wants a CB to play, he is so umcomfortable when put under any sort of pressure and his distribution isn't the best. Hopefully he succeeds elsewhere.

80~~~
Are you judging that over his whole career or just last season?

81~~~
He's not leaving until we secure a legit defender it seems but two weeks should be enough time to come up with something.

82~~~
That would be great.

83~~~
Yes please !

84~~~
Wants to join Everton, according to Sky. Tottenham, WBA and Stoke want him as well.

85~~~
That could hike up the fer we could get...sell to highest bidder....lets not  allow EVerton to cleverely us again...he signs elsewhere or trains with the reserves....we need a hardline stance, we are being mugged in terms of transfer fees especially sales to them ...has to end

86~~~
The players we've taken from you in the past you have clearly not wanted. We've not mugged you off. You've payed highly for our players because they were a) Highly rated ala Rooney or b) we needed big money to purchase other players/they have came off the back of an excellent season ala Fellaini.

87~~~
To Cleverly us again?

That is a trerrible post by the way.

88~~~
I assume because we got him on a free, because..eh..you didn't want him.

89~~~
Add to that the fact he didn't actually have a contract with us, the man was a free agent. No idea how he thinks different.

90~~~
I'm not saying the wrong has been on your part...its been on ours for allowing that...and even when unwanted, they were very good players below market value...which sets a precedent...i think thats what led to everton low balling us when we had already agreed a much higher fee with Villa...we need to reset the expectations...and woody and kenwright dont seem to have a good relationship either

91~~~
we had recieved and accepted an 8 mil fee with villa , when everton came in with a much lower fee, and the player then refused to move..we were then forced to loan him even though he had a year left on his contract.


Thanks for the concern. The word is 'terrible' btw

92~~~
No we didn't.

93~~~
Okay then..lets leave it at that

94~~~
Evans + cash for Stones please!

95~~~

96~~~
If Everton want him - would let him go. Nothing to do with Stones but, he really needs a change of scenery. I still think with a shot of confidence, he can be a quality CB for a team like Everton. I just don't see him getting his confidence back here, the fans I think are ready to turn on him soon as he makes a mistake and he probably realizes that - which will just make him scared on the pitch.

97~~~
We have to realise that we'd be giving Everton Stones' replacement as he goes to Chelsea. Ergo, we'd be strengthening a rival. 

Get maximum amount possible from Evans to make it at least worth it. Or heck, just get Stones ourselves and give money plus Jonny <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

98~~~
Don't even think about it without securing a proper defender. We offloaded Nani and RvP too quickly I think without knowing what's ahead of us but this time we should just take actions before making a decision to get rid players too quickly. The sake of minimizing the risk if you will.

Yes, Evans looks not too sharp these days but right now Jones is fecked on the start of the season. Complications, nothing new.

99~~~
Bit of chatter down South that he's signed for Saints.

100~~~
Would be a good move for him if so. It seems evident that he's not going to feature in our future plans, so it'd be a real shame if he's spending some of the main years of his career struggling to play football. He'll likely get some game time at Southampton, and it'll be good for him to feature for a side who could easily push for a decent top half finish again.

101~~~
That'd be a fantastic move for him. Hopefully it's true. Koeman could be a good manager to learn from for him.

102~~~
Indeed. Koeman remains one of the greatest CBs of all-time, and seems to be a competent manager who plays good football. For all the **** Evans takes on this forum, let's not forget about the talent he has. He showed his capabilities in that 2008-2011 period whenever one of Rio or Vida were absent, so his decline is exactly just that - a decline. He wasn't always this bad. He was once a very reliable back-up defender and perhaps he will rediscover some form at another club, if he sorts himself out mentally. He isn't United first XI quality (though he once looked like he would be our future CB for many years) but he receives far too much criticism for the [admittedly] terrible last two seasons he has had.

It seems his departure is a done deal. He's served us well and has always appeared to be dedicated and professional. I've met him & can say he is a nice person, too. I wish him the best of luck wherever he goes.

103~~~
Yeah I'd probably rather he went to Southampton than Everton. Purely because if he went to Everton it would mean Stones goes to Chelsea.

104~~~
If we're not in for Stones I don't see why this should bother anyone. Its inevitable that he'll join Chelsea if they keep up their interest and keep offering more for him

105~~~
I'd prefer to delay it as long as possible though, considering how poor Chelsea look in defence at the moment.

106~~~
He's done well this season.

107~~~
If I was a mid table prem club I would be in for him for sure. Patchy form for a couple of seasons, but before that he looked very high class and with regular football he could easily be a top PL defender for many years to come.

108~~~
This is the Evans thread. Who are you talking about?

109~~~
Evans. I think he's doing very well on the bench.

110~~~
He's doing well watching from the stands. Hasn't been on the bench this season.

111~~~
Even better.

112~~~
off to WBA.

They will get a good player.

113~~~
£6m rising to £8m.

Really thought he would be our best defender when van Gaal was announced. Just seemed an ideal fit compared to Smalling and Jones. Now I'm not sure who we'll miss more - him or his wife (MUTV presenter Helen McConnell)...

What a sad state of affairs for Jonny. Thanks for the medals and sterling performances throughout his career, it's a shame it's ended like this but we should all wish him the best and hope he can rejuvenate his career with Pulis.

114~~~
So long Johnny! I always liked him, shame he never quite reached his initial potential. All the best.
