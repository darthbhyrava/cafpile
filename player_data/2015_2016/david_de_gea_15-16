<span style="font-size: 12px">Consummate professional most likely stays for another year with us.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/lcnyPkH.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/lcnyPkH.png"/> 

What are your expectations for him this season? Can we expect some sulking, deflation? Or just another world class season...</span>

2~~~
I expect him to be professional, no sulking or sthing, you're an United player (although you hate it), do a job you're hired to do.

3~~~
I'm hoping he stays. With all the changes to our team we need some stability in key areas. feck the fee, he might be the difference between us winning a trophy this season. Trophies > monies.

4~~~
Fully expect another world class season from him, but won't enjoy it as much because I know he'll f*ck off to Madrid for nothing next summer.

5~~~
I don't doubt he has genuine affection for the club, so I don't see his performance levels dropping off in the slightest. Also, he'll want to be Spains number 1 at the Euros next year, and I don't think if he does end up staying, he'll be that bothered, as he'll get a whopping multi-million dollar pay out next year.

6~~~
If he stays he will definitely give his all for the season, and hopefully helps lead us to a trophy. LVG has repeatedly mentioned how professional he's been about the situation, and with the Euro's coming up next year he wouldn't want to end up not being first choice for Spain by being benched the entire year for sulking.

7~~~
Next summer will be a tough one they will need to buy a keeper and a striker..

8~~~
He'll pen a new deal at the end of the season when we've won the PL and the CL, with him being instrumental in both races, of course.

9~~~
He will sign.

10~~~
Pretty much this. If he does stay, I expect he'll perform superbly again, but I'd be shocked if he stays for more than that year.

11~~~
I believe the reports that De Gea was genuinely torn in deciding between here and Madrid and that he has really enjoyed his time here.He is only 24 and sure he will not resent spending 1 more year here.Even if he does resent it, he is a professional and I would expect him to act like it.

12~~~
I don't think he is going to sulk even if he is going to leave for free next year. He knows much more is at stake. He has buddies here and one year will run pretty quickly. He knows what we have done for him these past 4 years, especially Fergie shielding him and he will be ever grateful for that. I think he will give us one more good year and then be off.

13~~~
Sign an extension? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

14~~~
I expect him to have a great season for Madrid.

15~~~
Stays with his BFFs Mata and Herrera and together lifts one or two trophies by the end of the season..

16~~~
Come on David get your hands out of these gloves and sign the bloody contract.. We know deep down you really want to..

17~~~
Top 15 saves from last year... Jesus <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YLeID5fuRsE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

18~~~
Some of those save are superhuman... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

19~~~
Fair play if you keep this guy for another year. The proposed fee was nowhere near enough to consider going 12 months without him between the pegs. 

I reckon he'll just get on with it. No sulking or anything like that. Just 100% every game until he either leaves or signs a new contract.

20~~~
Not sure how to feel about de Gea this season, I'm sure he'll play brilliantly but he's still f*cking off next year.

21~~~
The Euros are coming up, throwing a tantrum and playing like shit is not what's best for De Gea's chances in the Spanish NT.

22~~~
I think he'd happily stay. I'm positive it's his girlfriend and his family that is pushing him for the move and he's actually quite happy here with his United amigos. So if United don't budge it's a happy excuse.

23~~~
It's worth losing him on a free to have someone making those saves for another year. And he will be at his best because there's a spot at the Euros up for grabs.

24~~~
It'd also be annoying having to replace him so quickly if United do end up selling him. With 4 new players and a possible 2 more, we need to ensure the defence keeps it's stability with De Gea in goal. Then we'll have time to assess the perfect replacement before getting him early in the next summer window.

25~~~
And for free as well.

26~~~
I'm still hoping we might make some kind of swap with Ramos. 

I'm sure he is professional enough to give his best, but every single mistake will be scrutinized this season and almost certainly he will have a at least a part of the crowd on his back if he doesn't perform at a very high level. He will be the player under most pressure from the fans to perform next season.

27~~~
Calling it, he's going to surpass Neuer this year, no basis for this other than how rapidly he's grown over the last two years <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

28~~~
In a way, if he stays and continues to improve it will be a bit sad knowing that he will definitely be leaving at the end of the season. Will make it harder to enjoy his performances.

29~~~
he could have another blinder like last season. still wont affect the outcome for him at euros.

30~~~
I thought he was already better this year, to be honest. He had an absolutely incredible season, and was instrumental in getting us fourth. Obviously Neuer is coming off the back of a World Cup and won the league with his team, and De Gea <i>only</i> finished fourth, but individually I felt he had a better season.

31~~~
Its goalkeeper heaven for him here. He makes loads of saves, impresses everybody, gets a lot of experience. You're probably right.

32~~~
If he stays, he might part ways with his smokin hot girlfriend over the course of the year. I'm sure Ed would be there with a £200k-per-week contract for him to wipe his tears on.

33~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/kQ1DCz2.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/kQ1DCz2.jpg"/>

Starts tonight.

34~~~
From his body expression it's obvious he wants to leave us. 

Is that Chicharito near him?

35~~~
Yeah, telling him what to expect at Real.

36~~~
So good at goal. Distribution so so, but again...so good at goal.

37~~~
He just exudes confidence these days.

38~~~
This cnut needs to stay this season. So good he is.

39~~~
I have changed my mind. I dont want to swap him for ramos. I just want him alone even if it means mcnair and blackett in defence. Feck you Perez

40~~~
I knew he would save that 1v1. It will be a sad day when I no longer have that confidence in our GK. His distribution seemed rusty. Although a lot of last season he had Fellaini to aim at too so that probably helped him.

41~~~
Pretty decent for his 1st game in some time. Gonna miss this guy when he leaves.

42~~~
He's not very keen on moving outside the six-yard box, is he? There was a point in tonight's game where Young tackled the ball from Pedro (I think) toward our goalline. Young had to sprint half the pitch to get back (and eventually concede a corner) while de Gea was just standing still looking at Young's efforts.

43~~~
The Bjorn Borg of goalkeepers, ice cool in everything he does.

44~~~
was good but almost fecked up the goal, lucky Suarez hit the post from freekick....

45~~~
Top class performance, again. Hope he stays for another year. His presence is priceless, even 50m from his sale won't get us what he can by staying - trophies. I really really hope he signs an extension, though. That would the signing of the summer for me.

46~~~
Time for Woody to get the finger out, make De Gea an offer he cant refuse. A nice bonus for signing a new contract and make him the top paid player at the club.

47~~~
I'd imagine he's done all of that.

48~~~
I don't care if we don't bring in anyone for the next two windows if we can get him to stay

49~~~
He showed why he's worth much more than 25mn Euros or so. LVG is right to keep him and let him go for free

50~~~
Definitely the biggest flaw in his game. Probably his only significant flaw. Totally glued to his line. Defenders are usually screaming at him to come wide and show for a pass, or come out and claim a ball which he should be cleaning up no problem. If he nails that part of his game, then there'll be nobody better than him in the world.

51~~~
I doubt that we have offered him 300k+/week, which would make him the top paid player here.

52~~~
He had perfected that during the season I felt, but this was his first game in pre season, off the back of a back injury apparently, so he probably wasn't totally comfortable playing libero and maybe wanted to limit his movement to a minimum. I think he's actually quite good as a sweeper on the basis of what we saw last year.

53~~~
He's been having a poor game.

Should have been directly responsible for 2 goals. Though Zlatan let him off once.

54~~~
I hope Perez is watching

55~~~
He's having a shocker, he can't do anything right.

56~~~
Taken off due to poor performance ?

57~~~
Doesn't sound great. Hopefully we keep him, would be annoying to give into Madrid especially after they just renewed Ramos. Would make us look like mugs if we sold now.

58~~~
Can't help but think he's pressuring the club to sell.Didn't look like him today.

59~~~
I was sure that he will leave and I think today pretty much sealed the deal.

60~~~
Personally thought he'd be staying for another year but after today I don't know anymore. Hopefully he doesn't go, will be really annoying for us if we do sell him.

61~~~
We have to sell him if he's going to continue to play like that. It's a real shame that we will end up losing to RM once again.

62~~~
This is the problem with keeping a player who wants to leave, particularly a GK. Every time he messes up people will say it's because he doesn't care and the pressure on him will keep increasing. Not the sort of environment you need to succeed.

63~~~
Strange criticism of him. 

He was great against Barca. Also at times last season and over his career he has been hesitant about coming out. Second half of last season he improved that.

64~~~
He needs to be gone, both for himself and the club. Mentally he's not here and if we keep him simply for the purpose of Woodward waving his cock at RM things won't improve throughout the season. He'll then walk away for nothing at the end of the season and that will be that. This is currently a lose-lose situation, Woodward needs to face reality.

65~~~
I say Woodward do not back down. It's just too bad but I have no sympathy for Dave. Put his ass on the bench if he wants to sulk/is mentally not here, and let it sink in that he's blowing his Euro 2016 chances whilst he's sat there. 

Should have done the right and sensible thing by signing the contract and giving RM no option but to pay up. He's brought this on himself and I do not want us caving in.

66~~~
The issue is whether we want to be pushed by RM again.  I don't mind he had a bad game (it's preseason), because he has been utterly professional throughout the off season and this tour.  Look, his head is obviously screwed up.  That said, when he knows that the transfer window is closed and he is still here, he knows he needs to play well to secure that move to Madrid and be the no.1 for his national team for the Euros (Suarez, the consumate turncoat after all Liverpool did for him, still played hard and sucked it up for one more year before he got his wish to go to Barca).  Perhaps the board (like some others here) is saying to Ed to get real and get some money back from RM instead of letting him go free next year.  But, imo, that makes us a joke and a bitch for RM once again...

67~~~
I'd rather have him sitting on the bench for U21s for a year and loosing him for free next summer than giving in to Real  and their lowball offers.

68~~~
Maybe he just had a bad game?

69~~~
I tend to agree. However, it doesnt really make sense to keep him if he wants out badly. Only if he says "fine I stay for another season" it makes sense to keep him. But then again, we shouldnt give in to RM either. Tricky situation

70~~~
Yes, he's not going to be very motivated this year if he doesn't want to be at the club

71~~~
Euros mate.

72~~~
If he doesn't want to be here I'd sell him. 

I don't understand the sense in keeping him for a year to lose out on £20m odd. Granted if his contract was longer he'd be worth more, but it isn't.

We should of been after Cech.

73~~~
He could do nothing with the second goal. First goal he was in two minds probably about whether to come out of his line or not. Jones and Shaw were closing him they failed and he was too late in coming out. He made a pass straight to ibra in the 2nd minute who shot it high. 

Other than this, I thought he was fine. Johnstone came for getting a few minutes under his belt for the next 45. He didn't look like he didn't care.

74~~~
Like Suarez?

75~~~
It's becoming frustrating, in the club point of view.

We train a player who wants to leave, giving him too much time and consideration. The club is always bigger than individuals. At least he's no forcing anything like the Argentinian's tw**. These two issues are worrying and sending a very bad image of our club of unhappy players

We should sell DDG, lower our fee to 30M€, letting us the time to recruit somebody quickly whether its Cillessen, Leno or Lloris.

76~~~
Once we play him in Europe or the transfer window closes and he knows it's not happening he'll sort himself out and concentrate on the rest of the season.

77~~~
Caught out by the slow pitch

78~~~
Not a good performance by him, but not sure it's got anything to do with his mental state. Just a poor performance.

79~~~
Once he gets his head round the idea that he won't be joining Real this season, it'll be in his interest to do well. And I think he will.

LvG should just sit him down and explain to him (hopefully with a translator) that the club has decided to forego whatever transfer fee in exchange for one more good season from him.

80~~~
His game against Barcelona was really good though. I wouldn't draw too many conclusions from his performance yesterday.

81~~~
Doesn't matter how bad he performs, we can't let him go now without looking like idiots, nobody will take us serious again if we do. It's a matter of principle now.

If he can't stay focused put him on the bench and play someone else.

82~~~
I thought it was just a bad game to be honest. He was fine against Barcelona? I'm sure once the season starts he will perform to his optimum level. He'll be in Madrid sooner rather than later anyway, can't see why it would bother him for too much longer.

83~~~
29 million bid from Madrid according to Independent: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/david-de-gea-to-real-madrid-real-finally-get-their-man-with-29m-bid-for-manchester-united-goalkeeper-10478347.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...or-manchester-united-goalkeeper-10478347.html</a>

84~~~
Accept it and let him go. There's actually no point in keeping him if his mind is elsewhere and we're not gonna play him.

85~~~
Not if we get the asking price for him. It'll be a win if we do, sticking two fingers up at Madrid.

86~~~
That's almost €40m. I don't believe that Madrid suddenly believe that they need him no matter what especially when they have not conceded yet

87~~~
Over €40m, surely?

88~~~
Not sure of the exact rates but it should be around €41m yes

89~~~
The rates are brutal right now. I'm spending euros in London this weekend and getting slaughtered.

90~~~
This would be awful to let him go now, Madrid can't just string it along all summer then expect to get him at the last minute, hope we tell them to get lost.

91~~~
€39.92 by todays rates.

92~~~
Can't believe I'm saying this but if the €40 million reports are to be believed, we should definitely sell him now rather than pay his wages for another year, lose out on the transfer fee, have him sit on the bench (the trainer coach's stubbornness on matters of principle knows no bounds), and watch him sign a pre-contract halfway through the season. The relationship between David and Louis seems fractured beyond repair to be honest, so odds are firmly in the non-extension camp. As for the defense, it does look more secure with defensively proficient fullbacks, Schneiderlin will shield them from midfield, and Romero might make a couple of mistakes, but it wouldn't exactly cost us the season. Don't believe he's as indispensable to the team now as he was last season.

93~~~
Yep. Add the wages there and we are talking for a loss of around 45m euros (33m pounds or so). A big amount of money to lose for a single season, especially without guarantee that he'll play; or that he'll play that good.

In the other side, I would like us to do a Wenger and to ask Madrid for an another 4m or so, just to make it a transfer record. It would be easily to get it, Real Madrid loves to break transfer records and when they'll understand that they are near it, they'll just add the money.

94~~~
You are talking a lot of sense but I don't entirely trust Blind and Romero in that defense, I fear that both are one nightmare performance from having their confidence shattered and us truly fecked. But if Van Gaal has another GK in mind, not that Dutch lad, then yeah get DDG the feck out of this club both for his and our good because LVG is not playing him again.

95~~~
30m are 30m. We should have lined in for a new goalkeeper long ago

96~~~
Perhaps. 

But I don't really share that view on Romero (understand that's not the most popular opinion). Really believe he is good enough as a one season stopgap provided the defensive line holds up and restricts a high volume of direct shots on target (which it has so far, albeit against weaker opposition). That should ideally give us enough time to whittle down the last of targets and sign a new long term (hopefully) keeper come January or the summer transfer window, not really convinced with Cilessen either. The assessment of Blind I kind of agree with. He might have a torrid time against some of the more physical strikers in the league, but then again, he has kind of ***-proven our skepticism so far (long maybe it continue <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>) and operates as Van Gaal's brain from the back. I'm also a believer in Rojo, who is more athletic and can form a good partnership with Smalling, and doesn't shy away from physical contact. That said, you'r right it only takes a couple of games for everything to fall apart, Smalling is the glue that holds the defense together this season. God forbid he goes down injured, might cause an adverse domino effect.

97~~~
29m is not far off the price we're asking for. Accept it and move on
De Gea is a rare talent but his mind is elsewhere. he won't be missed here.

98~~~
The club will have known this was very likely to happen, and will surely have a contingency plan in place. The fee touted sends a message to Real that we will not be pushed around in future.
A season of DDG at his peak, might be worth turning down a significant sum for. But if his mind is elsewhere, there is no guarantee that he would return to last season's form.

99~~~
Seeing Romero play yesterday and John Stones for Everton on Saturday made me wonder why we've had DDG benched all month. Stone's even submitted a transfer request which DDG hasn't done yet he was still picked and played well on Saturday. DDG would have done his job professionally all month.

100~~~
I have thought the same. Just fecking play him. Guaranteed we wouldn't have lost yesterday if he played.

101~~~
He definitely would've stopped the second one, and I'm not sure he'd have conceded the first. Romero is pretty brutal, I really hope we resolve the issue soon. 

I don't think there'll be a problem if we keep him, I think he'll perform fine this year. The Euros are at the end of the year, and if he wants to cement his place in the Spanish team, he's going to have to have a very good season.

102~~~
Let's vent some frustration on them scousers.

103~~~
We go again!

104~~~
LvG and Giggs need to set a meeting with him and get his head on right, we are going to need him this season.

105~~~
He'll be a big reason why we are in the CL next season. Hopefully the CM will help him do less.

I expect 1-0's, 2-1's, 1-1's and 0-0's galore. He'll be the difference in keeping that one goal advantage or keeping a draw.

106~~~
Put him in immediately, obviously, no point in waiting any longer, he'll take a few games to get into form no matter.

107~~~
Luckily, first game is a pushover, will have something to do, but nothing too much or dangerous.

108~~~
If we play him and in January he agrees a free transfer for the summer he should be left rot.

109~~~
Will we get to see him in the Special Suit?

110~~~
Pffft... To the Valdes thread.

111~~~
All I`m saying is what a cnut this guy is, youre at a top club, getting the highest wages any GK will get, have 75k fans at home every match, what else do you want

112~~~
To live with your girlfriend in your home town where you were brought up.

113~~~
Im pretty sure singers and footballers like them dont wait months to meet up and have bang bang time, most are in "open relationships" and do what they want. Theres hundreds of footballers playing in leagues not in their home country, theres also alot of spanish players in the Pl for a while now, this "homesick" thing is very naive and oversimplistic, that he just wants to be home

114~~~
That would all be valid if we knew the guy but we don't. He's probably not homesick but most definitely he'd prefer to live in Madrid and he'll be there soon enough and good luck to him if you ask me.

115~~~
He never handed in a transfer request and has hasn't publically said anything. Ronaldo compared himself to a slave when he wanted to leave. De Gea's behaviour has been fine and I'm sure he'll play well if selected.

116~~~
The one thing LVG and Ed need to make clear to him is that we were willing to sell but Real fecked it up. A chance to show some man management ability. Hopefully he doesn't hold this all against us and is amenable a new contract with bigger wages and a reasonable release clause. Everyone's *almost* happy.

117~~~
Yes because that's all there is to life. Wise up.

118~~~
He's just too good of a player to drop, he will get some stick at the first game but supporters will get over it. He will leave on a free in the end but that's our fault for not tying him up with a long contract, can't really hate the guy for wanting to play for Madrid, it's not like he wants to sign for league rival like City or Chelsea.

119~~~
I just want to see him one more time at least. Just once more, making miraculous saves. He'll be off at the end of the season but Van Gaal better at least put him back in. He's our best GK by a long, long way.

120~~~
Did he play for Spain?

121~~~
Nope.

122~~~
So again Casillas?

Drop him already!

123~~~
Casillas apparently. 

It gives me hope for him signing that deal with a view to settle his situation, get back in the side and earn his spot for the Euros. 

There's no way he wants to be the centre of drama for a year and miss out next year.

124~~~
Casillas' status in Spanish national side is beyond a joke.

125~~~
It's no different to the Gerrard-Lampard selection. Both of whom had built up strong relationships with journalists who had made their non-selection difficult for the manager. 

If they weren't selected you could guarantee questions would be asked about the manager.

126~~~
why is there a dot in the thread title? special attention?

127~~~
Look at the furor that accompanied Raul being dropped in 2008. It seems hierarchy plays a huge role in the Spanish set up. I have always believed Casillas would be number one for the Euros regardless of De Gea's form.

128~~~

David when he was a little boy.

129~~~
Funny how many Spaniards look so, uh, not Spanish.

130~~~
Just watched Sunday supplement apparently DDG is the victim in all this transfer mess! Lol hope LVG doesn't allow him to pull on the united shirt again!

131~~~
You sure that's not a picture of him now in a wig?

132~~~
Haha, he hasn't changed much yeah. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

133~~~
Why?

134~~~
I've decided to take the nip with him Cheesy. Heard he's not happy with United! Excuse me but are we not paying him bucketloads to play for us? Hardly a hardship there ungrateful little fecker. I would prefer somebody who wants to be here than have someone who is about to jump as soon as his contract is up. Feck him let him sit out for a year.

135~~~
Ronaldo wanted to leave, and wasn't particularly happy in his final year at times. We still played him though, because he was our best player. De Gea's entitled to want to leave: it might be shite for us, but he's not gone to the point of treating the club like Tevez treated City, for example. He's still here, and we'd be daft not to use him while we can.

136~~~
We got £80m for Ronnie and he signed a new deal so we'd get paid! DDG the snake is going to slink out without us getting a penny!

137~~~
Possibly. He could potentially sign a new deal, although I'll admit I'm not entirely convinced he will.

Even then though, it's not De Gea's job to get us a transfer fee: we should've had a more long-term contract tied up a couple of years ago if we were going to moan about not getting a fee for him.

138~~~
I'd agree with that just think we could have DDG and Pogba for the next 5 years. But I do think DDG has strung us along for last 2 years.

139~~~

140~~~
Played 90 minutes and kept a clean sheet for Spain tonight away to Macedonia. Anyone watch the game and know how he did? Hopefully he looked sharp and it gives him more of a chance to start on Saturday.

141~~~
We should learn our lesson from this ..It is naive to think that all our players will decide to stay when given renewals in the last year of their contracts..Keep the renewals with a year to go to the Young and the Valencia's of this world..but with 2 and a half years left with our bigger names, we should be discussing new deals.

142~~~
and you don't think we opened talks with De Gea with 2 and a half years to go?

143~~~
Neither of us can say conclusively..but judging perhaps from other deals we have had with other players  it appears that we do regularly offer contracts to some players around that 12-18 months  left mark( Smalling and Jones for example),so it may be true here..I'm not attacking the club btw before anyone attacks me..rather what Id like to see us do in future IF we havent started with it, and have contingency measures if the contract negotiations are taking a long time to not end up in a similar situation.

144~~~
Not sure if legit but account does have 109k followers

2 and a half years is to late imo

That is basically what he said after the match.

147~~~
We offer 4 year contracts usually( with an option for another), so renewing just a year into that new contract would cost us..I wonder why we dont offer 6 year contracts like Madrid do...Well except  with him of course, and that didn't end well...

148~~~
Mark my words for it; our attacking displays are going to improve so much better when this guys gets back. 

Van gaals team is all about distance from the defenders and the strikers and having a goalkeeper like de gea will only allow our defenders to more bravely push up the field. 


Bring it on!

149~~~
You guys do realise that when his contract had 2 and a half years to go, Moyes was still our manager and we didn't look like qualifying for the CL, right?

I'm guessing we did start talks, but DDG and Jorge Mendes probably came up with the excuse that they will only sign if we qualify for CL. That allowed them to run down the clock and now we end up with this mess.

150~~~

151~~~
Good job Woody. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

152~~~
Very true, both Ronaldo and Suarez did this for their clubs. I don't know why DDG won't sign the contract

153~~~
He's a goalkeeper, Perez doesn't see them as galactico signings. He surely improved his chances of Real Madrid chasing him by running down his contract to 1 year, although he might extend now given the deal has fallen trough.

154~~~
One thing I have learnt from the Spanish papers this Summer is how they easily tell one story and then report the exact opposite days later..Until he has signed the contract, I 'll remain sceptical.

155~~~
I'm happy to be optimistic.

156~~~
Ronaldo signed a new deal around about April 2006, if memory serves me right, which is over a year before the saga of the 2008 summer and over two years before he actually left. He never signed a deal so we'd get more money for him. He signed it to get a better deal.

157~~~
I've been scarred by football ....Buts lets hope your optimism is rewarded..

158~~~
From the El Confidencial article on Sport Bible Mendes was quoted as saying;

159~~~
We offer four year contracts, with an added year if the club wants, to protect us in case a signing completely flops.

160~~~
Has to start vs the scousers. 

Romero is just a feck up waiting to happen, our backline with the addition of De Gea will be perfect.

161~~~
Barely even touched the ball. Macedonia had no attack. They might as well have put no one on goal and Macedonia still wouldn't have scored.

Looks like Torres.

162~~~
Out of curiosity if Madrid back off from De Gea but he still wants to move to Spain would anyone here consider Claudio Brave from Barcelona? Brilliant keeper. 

Or even Oblak from A.Madrid.

163~~~
I don't think there's the slightest possibility that he'll settle for A. Madrid at this stage of his career. He's one of the best goalkeepers in the world, and despite his quiet nature he didn't get where he is today by not being ambitious. The only clubs he'll leave us for are Real and maybe* Barca.

*Not meant as a slight to Barca, they will obviously dominate football for the coming years, but he seems intent on Madrid, not Barcelona.

164~~~
Jonathan King has just opened a new account on here.

165~~~
I agree 100% but I was just asking would people be happy enough with either keeper to replace him. Just curios, nothing more.

166~~~
Oh, right.

I guess I would be happy with either of them. Preferably Oblak though, as he is younger and not latin <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

170~~~
Edurne, you gloryhunter!

171~~~
Romero would have saved it.

172~~~
Saw him smile a few times during the game.   He looked happy to be playing with us again.

173~~~
2 great saves.

Welcome back De Goat!

174~~~
Bar that one moment of madness, he was good ol' Dave for us.

175~~~
Was brilliant after the mistake.

176~~~
That clip gave me goosebumps <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>  (Didn't hear it earlier in pub from United fans in fine voice) 

Had a brilliant game, couple of brilliant saves and a pity to lose a clean sheet but what a goal it was. 

8/10 performance, started exactly where he left off.

177~~~
Great to have Dave back.

178~~~
Very much so.

179~~~
You see how much the defensive line moved forward when de gea was in goal.  Our defenders were inches away from our own half way line &  that sir is what trust and belief is.

180~~~
It feels like an edurnity has passed since we were all hating on her <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

*Grabs coat*

181~~~
One nervy moment, couple of good saves and composed the rest of the time, great to have him back in goal.

182~~~
Great to have him back.

183~~~
Hmmmm. Bittersweet seeing that tweet. It's obvious she doesn't actually mean it fully, of course she'd want her boyfriend back in Spain with her.
Still, it definitely reflects well if she does it even so - so fair play to her.

Apart from one or two drunk moments, he was great. Good to have him back. Only beaten by a stunner from Benteke.

184~~~
With him we can challenge for a trophy, this premier league could be a weird one with the strength of the midtable teams, they have bought well and now when behind and they have to attack they will be more dangerous than in previous seasons, De Gea's ability to win a match on his own and our stronger defence could be key.

185~~~
The reaction to all three goals.

188~~~
Felt he went with the wrong hand for the goal but is super-harsh given it was such a wonder strike. Benteke defo not good enough for us though...lol

189~~~
I was actually thinking that, especially if he tried use both hands instead of his far reaching hand. A lot of power though so we'll let it slide.

190~~~
head clearly in Madrid

191~~~
Anybody that says he should have saved Bentekes goal seriously has high hopes, the power it came at home and the unnatural curve made it very difficult to judge. 

To be fair he got close to it, but I have no quarrels about that. He made some impressive saves throughout the game though which was pleasing to see, majority of his kicking was good apart from that 1 dodgy moment.

192~~~
No keeper is saving that. Expectations are ridiculous.

193~~~

194~~~
Indeed but not every goal keeper is as ridiculous as him.

195~~~
<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

196~~~
Agreed.

197~~~
I don't think the comments would be so positive if Romero put in that performance.

198~~~
I loved the save off the mishit, it was a tiny DDG is back moment.

199~~~
So happy to have him back. We gave him a huge ovation when his name was read out at the beginning (they announcer waited last to announce him haha).

His first touch was cheered, his first catch was cheered, and we chanted his name quite a bit. Big win having him this season.

200~~~
The fact that he even dived for bentekes goal says a lot about his ability. He was quick to react and attempt a save even though most keepers would have just stood there watching.

201~~~
It was impressive he even got nears Benteke's goal. Most goalkeepers would have been rooted to the spot. It's that he got a hand near it that some people think should have stopped it but you can't take anything away from the strike.

202~~~
Aside from the uncharacteristic distribution, which we could out down to him not playing a lot of football lately, what exactly was wrong with his performance?

203~~~
I didn't mean that to sound like I thought it was a poor performance, it was definitely a solid performance for someone who hasn't played much recently. But he made a huge error that would have cost us a goal if not for Smalling, Romero would have been crucified for that while it's just getting glossed over for De Gea.

204~~~
Apart from that one error he was good. I thought his save from Ings was impressive, would not have surprised me if Romero had conceded that.

205~~~
Romero would probably have conceded at least two goals off of the saves DDG made today. And they weren't even DDG 'specials'.

Just shows you how good he is.

206~~~
Exactly, they are leagues apart and that's not hyperbolic in the least.

207~~~
Great game for someone who has not played all season barring a game for Spain. Plus we have to remember he is coming back from an injury from last season. Great game I believe and we can only see him get better this season. <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/><img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

208~~~
I thought considering the circumstances he was great yesterday

209~~~
Woody will take him to the cleaners if he tries again <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

210~~~
I am just glad this thread is still available and that the performances are for us.

211~~~
The saves from Ings and Clyne were both excellent, we've just become accustomed to seeing that kind of thing from him.

212~~~
The Ings one was difficult save to pull off, because we didn't know where the ball would end up because of the bounce.

For De Gea they were basic saves though.

213~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

214~~~
Same here. IMO prvented two goals from going in. Bit dodgy on the ball but he will iron it out

215~~~
Btw the Sun are saying that there is a 30 mil buyou option in his contract.

216~~~
A little bit rusty but glad to see how disappointed with himself he looked after that mistake kick to a Liverpool player. Played a lot better after that, too. Dave's back!

217~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/report-de-gea-contract-has-gbp30m-buyout_245866.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/footbal...de-gea-contract-has-gbp30m-buyout_245866.html</a>

He is off next summer for 30 million....

218~~~
Let's wait for a reliable outlet, Sportsmole and The Sun are hardly gospel. Sportsmole are actually citing The Sun.

219~~~
I can't quite figure out why we'd agree to that buyout clause tbh. Seriously hope it is bullshit, which it does sound like, unless there is a lot more to this whole thing than we know about. That figure really is at the bottom end of any valuation of him.

220~~~
Apparently played a part in Blind's off-the-line clearance as well:

"The 25-year-old also made a crucial clearance off the line to deny Liverpool with the score at 1-0 and he credited returning goalkeeper David De Gea for his role in the second half incident: 'It was an important moment,' Daley told us. 'Just before the corner David told me something and that I needed to be there, and I was there so it was good. We laughed about it afterwards.'"

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Sep/Daley-Blind-reflects-on-goal-against-Liverpool.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...Blind-reflects-on-goal-against-Liverpool.aspx</a>

221~~~
"Ey Daley watch the post wont ya? You're not marking anyone you short arse!"

222~~~
Brilliant stuff, not only are his reflexes good but he can organise the defence too.

223~~~
If he doesn't sign then he goes for nothing...the fact that he'd cost Madrid £30m now makes it a great contract for us. I have no doubt that he'll be off and there probably is a clause at a value that Madrid have told Mendes they'll pay, so Madrid essentially take a hit because they messed up the deal. We get a year to agree a deal for a replacement, De Gea gets a pay rise, makes the Euros possibly as a starter and Madrid get a world class Keeper...everyone wins to a degree.

224~~~
I get all that and yesterday reminded us of what we've been missing (if ever we needed it). Would just be happier if any buyout clause was more c£50m and I had a faint and possibly naive hope that he was pissed at Real and might actually stay here beyond this season. We live in hope.

225~~~
Woody wouldn't give him 200k / w and a 30m release clause.

226~~~
I wish I could believe it...in my mind he's already gone.

227~~~
Why not? An extra £100k or so a week to ensure you get £30m, rather than nothing at the end of year...he'd be stupid to turn it down.

228~~~
At least we know he is going to be fecking immense this season again. Just need him to hook up with a local lass.

229~~~
I'd offer up my sister if it meant he'd stay.

230~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>Send him pics! Not sure my brother's gnarly arse will tempt him.

231~~~
He had that one brain fart that almost resulted in a goal but other than that he was really excellent. That save from Ings' shot was something that Romero would have probably let in.

232~~~
I wonder if he could have. Does Romero have the jungle panther agility to block that Ings shot?

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/eFjJLzHgBvP/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

233~~~
Ok why not. But until I something that is not the Sun report it I might believe it..

234~~~
I think he would have saved the Ings one, I think that's a pretty standard save even with the bounce. The second save there is better than I remembered though, Romero might not have saved that tbf. Although I think he probably would have, his shot stopping is one of his strong points.

235~~~
You may be right, Romero probably could keep out some of the tough ones, but then he seems to let in some very routine balls as well. That's what worries me the most about him, that bit of carelessness. De Gea gives us solidity.

236~~~
Pics?

237~~~
I don't get why it is universally accepted that he will leave at the end of season.

Real Madrid will be very pissed off if he signed a deal still intending to leave.

238~~~
The release clause is pure speculation. This was a contract extension, very few external parties involves, so even less chance of a news "leak". It's pure speculation from pundits and the media. They probably can't accept that United did not come out as losers in our dealing with Madrid - doesn't make good reading for ABUs out there. Anyway, even if there is a buy-out clause, I can't imagine it being 5mil less than what we had originally demanded from Madrid this summer.

239~~~
I posted this in newbie section, might as well post it here too:

I am not saying he won't go to Madrid, but those who say it's a dead cert should also consider the fact that United have bumped his wages to £200K/week.

Madrid do not pay that kind of wages to a goalkeeper/defender (How much is Ramos on now?) , they would happily pay it to a goal scorer/Galactico but not a goalkeeper. If they do, he would become their 3rd best-paid player behind Bale and Ronaldo. Would he be happy to take pay cut to join Madrid?

Also, If their was any truth behind a release clause (30m), the Spanish Media would be all over it. United might have a gentleman's agreement with De Gea & Mendes about letting him go for a specific amount, but if their was a release clause of 30m in his contract cnuts like Duncan Castles (who has close ties with Mendes) would be taking a lot of mileage out of this story already. Not to mention, Marca and Spanish journos like Gulleam Ballbag.

240~~~
How is it that an average, bitter and bald journalist have close ties to one of the most powerful men in football? I'm not disputing his connection with Mendes, just bloody curious about it!

241~~~
That save was fecking outrageous. 

<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a>

242~~~
Epic save. One of his best to date.

243~~~
Thank god for dodgy fax machines.

244~~~
Reminded me of the Torres one, the ball already behind him, just ridiculous.

247~~~
Romero would have caught it

248~~~
Most important signing (resigning) of the season.  We lose this game with Romero in nets.  What a goalkeeper.

249~~~
He's incredible!

250~~~
De God.

251~~~
That's 2 points extra thanks to him.

252~~~
God.

253~~~
He cheated on me but I forgive him. Never thought I would. Submissive with Edurne but dominant in the net.

254~~~
Give him another new contract.

255~~~
I Love you!

256~~~
Romero would have saved all of that with his eyes closed. De Gea should have still left for Madrid

<span style="color: #ffffff">Jodan</span>

257~~~
Dave saves <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

258~~~
Speechless. What a keeper.

259~~~
Nobody can touch this guy.

260~~~
I'm not sure how anybody dispute he's the best on the planet.

261~~~
World #1

262~~~
Thanks for the points again. Irreplaceable.

263~~~
That was what God said when he first saw De Gea.

264~~~
Dave always saves

265~~~
He always wins us points. So thankful we still have him. Could've been a different story if DDG wasn't here..

266~~~
Navas is playing a blinder for Real. I wonder if De Gea will indeed leave next summer.

267~~~
Incredible stop. Did really well to stop the effort from Mane that resulted in the first goal as well. Really hope he is here for the long term!

268~~~
People talk about us not having enough match-winners in the side when De Gea's been winning us games week in, week out. Match-winners don't all have to be attacking players.

269~~~
Can we change the name of this thread to De Gea Football Superhero please?

270~~~
It'll be so difficult to replace him. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

271~~~
He is the best there is no doubt about that.

272~~~
He was brilliant but I am disappointed by what is happening with his kicking , it used to be such an asset but he has been making a lot of poor kicks this season

273~~~
He's a difference maker, you can't underestimate the importance of a world class keeper, almost as important as a world class striker as they have key moments in games that can change outcomes.

274~~~
De Gea eh? So glad he's with us and proving himself for the Spanish team. Not sure what will happen in the future, but Dave, eventually the model gf will leave you, it's inevitable, it does generally happen with footballers and in Manchester you are revered, a God, so you can have the pick of any of the Manc chav ladies going....

275~~~
Amazing

fecking amazing that we got him on a new deal too even though he might leave in the near future anyway, but who knows. Things change.

276~~~
Incredible save. I remember Schmeichel making one of those one handed saves once while on his backside agaisnt Arsenal. And Seaman did that one against Sheffield United that time. DDGs today was similar.

277~~~
Simply no replacing the best goalkeeper in the world, because that's what he is.

278~~~
He is God and Good

279~~~
He is irreplaceable.

280~~~
One of Ferguson's best signings.

281~~~
For me he is the best keeper in the world.

282~~~
didn't hold onto it

283~~~
I'm not having athe Neuer is better than this guy argument.

284~~~
De Gea could make Rajinikanth look mediocre.

285~~~
"Heurelho Gomes without the shot-stopping"

286~~~
Marcotti and Patrick Barclay?

287~~~
Immense. Sensational saves.

288~~~
During the contract wrangle and the long thread made about it, I stated that he was the best GK in the World.
I still believe this.
His saves today didn't really surprise me - it's what I expect of the best GK in the World.

289~~~
Best keeper in the world.

290~~~
Best signing of the season. Class!

291~~~
Simply phenomenal.

292~~~
This can't be an opinion anymore. Neuer is just not as good as DDG, not at all. I never rated Neuer, but I'm not biased, DDG is already better than Neuer/Courtois ever was.

293~~~
Best in the world, no doubt about that. He'll be off to Madrid next summer so I hope we can arrange a suitable replacement.

294~~~
Just imagine, we could have lost him for free next season or got an inferior keeper this summer.

Would have been such a nightmare to have Madrid get De Gea for feck all

295~~~
That summer story has been worth it and it's just brilliant that he stayed

296~~~
That header save... David De Cat.

297~~~
Showed his value to us today with a couple of brilliant saves. Irrespective of what he does next summer, he's invaluable to us.

298~~~
That header save was incredible.

299~~~
Best 'keeper in the world, simple as.

300~~~
If you "never rated Neuer" you don't really know what you're talking about.  Whether David is better than him is a real debate I feel - its close and they're both top class keepers - but "never rated Neuer"?  Seriously?

301~~~
Never rated him as the world's best, yes, seriously.

302~~~
It's not such a ridiculous statement to say he's the best in the world ...it's debatable!

303~~~
He's just insanely good. He really does make saves that he just has no right too.

304~~~
Nah, I doubt he goes at this point. He's our for keeps.

305~~~
I love the sense of focus and concentration on the ball, his ability to track and predict shots as they develop is a joy to watch.

306~~~
I'd love to see a compilation of just opposing fans' reactions when he stops a surefire goal. The hands on head and that "yeeeaooohhwha???" sound - love it!

307~~~
After a tough summer where he slipped down my list of favourite players it is safe to say he is back on top. What a man <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. Won't get into the best in the world debate but all I know is that I wouldn't trade him for Neuer or Courtois.

308~~~
Thats fair enough.  Its a judgement call after all - you're entitled to your opinion about whos the best.  The suggestion was however that you didnt "rate" Neuer generally - which would of course be absolutely ridiculous.

309~~~
It's crazy that he still yet to keep a clean sheet this season and Romero has got 2.

310~~~
incredible to think that romero has to face only 3 or 4 shots on goal in 4 or 5 games yet de gea needs to make 4 or 5 top saves every single game he's played in.

311~~~
Thank heavens for a crappy internet connection and a hapless fax machine at Bernabeu!! We would have been in the 2nd half of the table if it wasn't for this guy in the last couple of games. He will be craving for a solid defense in front of him. What a gk!! World Class!!! Currently he is probably 1st or 2nd best in the world

312~~~
Big reason for this is the shaw injury imo

313~~~
And that he faced teams that offered feck all up front apart from Swansea, where Romero did poorly in.

314~~~
Also true.  Hopefully he'll be rewarded with a few clean sheets soon the guy deserves, although it's clear to a lot of us, and hopefully big Dave is aware of this, just how important and appreciated he is by us

315~~~
He wasn't tested in his first 3 games against poor opponents. He was sloppy and conceded 2 goals in his 4th.

316~~~
that's why i hope the defense can help him a bit here and give him an easier time in goal and get some clean sheets too.

317~~~
Hes a season or two ahead of Courtois in his development. Since Chelsea's defence has faltered hes shown some of the same weaknesses De Gea had in the early stages. Best in the world is tough to say, but best in the league undoubtedly.

DDG also needs to wake up a little. Hes had some dodgy kicks in the last few games, something he is usually excellent at.

318~~~
He seems more hesitant when Fellaini isn't on the pitch. He is usually pretty accurate hitting him when he is under pressure but without the 'Fellaini out-ball' he seems to panic and put them out of play a lot.

319~~~
Signing of the summer! 

I agree, him being the best on the planet isn't an opinion anymore. He had no right to get to that header last night.

320~~~
Made it into the top 10 plays of the day on ESPN even with a full day of NFL games, but they picked the wrong save.  Silly Yanks...

321~~~
His kicking was a bit off but besides that he was just brilliant again. Him and Neuer must be the two best goalkeeper by a mile

322~~~
That save off the corner <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> outrageous.

323~~~
You need to get banned for this blasphemy.

324~~~
I might just be bias but how can people say Courtois is better than De Gea? He's definitely the best in the Premier League and for me the second best in the world after Neuer of course. Don't get me wrong I do think Courtois is class but he's not quite as good as De Gea.

Having a world class goalkeeper is so important, he very rarely makes a mistake and quite often wins points for us on his own. The save from Fonte was out of this world.

325~~~
He has single handedly won us more points than any other player these past 28 months or so.

326~~~
At what point does our reliance on him run out become a worry? If it wasn't for his heroics we'd have been either drawing or losing seeing 66% of our goals came from 

1) Offside

2) Defensive brain fart

327~~~
If you guys haven't in a while, go back and watch the Ferguson last season review, Moyes season review and the Van Gaal season review just gone. <span style="color: #ffffff">(You can find filthy pigs who have uploaded torrents of all three so you can report them)</span>
A homage of all of his best saves in every game, just absolutely outrageous this lad. Love him to death.

328~~~
He was a captain after Rooney went out? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

329~~~
Was he? Smalling went off too and there was no Carrick so he could have been. BFS should really have got it though if that's the case

330~~~
Yeah, Rooney gave the armband to Bastian who gave it to DDG.

331~~~
To be fair, only Rooney, Carrick and Valencia have played more matches for us than him. If he had signed the contract last season, I think that he would have been chosen as third captain, ahead of Smalling.

Happy to see him getting the armband though. Although it was clear that armband or not, BFS was the leader on the pitch.

332~~~
If he signed last season, but he didnt and he wanted to leave the club in the last transfer period which ended few weeks ago! He wasnt able to play from the start of the season because his head wasnt in the right place and now he is the captain of the club, its a joke.

333~~~
ok

334~~~
ok

335~~~
I have no doubt a lot of the other players look up to him ability wise. Let's be honest, he is our best player ability wise in the squad. He is also one of the most senior players and has probably helped many of the Spanish speaking players settle into the squad. I have no problem making him 4th choice captain.

336~~~
Some very good kicking tonight, other than that had nothing to do.

337~~~

338~~~
Basti buttering up DDG for us there, making him feel respected, hopefully so that he stays after summer. LVG's agent. :P

Smart on Basti's end, I'd say. He's probably LVG's inside man in the club, the most trusted one, not Rooney.
All this talk about Rooney being consulted for team selections and cuisine and being made captain and undroppable is to make sure LVG has control over the squad, since they all look upto Rooney. It's a tactical decision. 

Basti's the alpha male there.

339~~~
1st clean sheet of the season for DDG

340~~~
ok

341~~~
He's a <span style="text-decoration: line-through">red</span> green. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

342~~~
In terms of reflex, kicks, and sweeping, Courtois is no where near De Gea. But in terms of dominating the box Courtois is better, arguably even better than Neuer.

343~~~
Courtois is just a massive guy in general, so he is going to outshine both of them. Like you said in terms of those other skills, he is no where near them.

344~~~
Is he? I wouldn't say so, he is prone to coning out for balls that he will never get. I recall the two Thiago Silva headers against Chelsea last season where Courtios got lucky on the first for being in no man's land and then was punished for the second occasion by a goal.

345~~~
No way.

346~~~
I know that everybody thinks that they have the best looking wife, but I truly believe we have the best GK in the World, in DDG.
I said this during the Summer saga and no doubt Madrid believed this as well.

347~~~
I have watched almost every Neuer game in the past 12 month and Imo, he isn't better than De Gea.

348~~~
He has been at the club since 2011 so I think he should be considered a senior player though he's only 24. Times flies!

349~~~
Agreed. He's the 'cool' goalkeeper to like because he does come out for mad balls and sweeping where no other keeper would risk, that's the only reason people mention him being better than De Gea when in fact he's not as good. 

Anytime you see Neuer pop up on a facebook page its because he's up at the half way line dribbling past a player whereas De Gea is in the newsfeed for an impossible save. That's the difference.

350~~~
I'm sure the question's been asked and answered before but have there been many other keepers in history that save the ball as often with their feet? I find it genuinely ridiculous how good he is at it. It feels like he's uniquely good at it.

351~~~
You stole my post. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

352~~~
Three saves today and all with his feet.

353~~~
Nice clean sheet for him, never looked like letting in a goal.

354~~~
Deserves the clean sheet today. Nice leg saves too.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He must be high or something

356~~~
Ive always wondered why keepers ignored using their feet. There are goals like the Swansea winner where I reckon id save simply because im not a keeper and would favor using my feet more.

Yep, when it come to goalkeeping stuff, De Gea has Neuer beat for me.

357~~~
Going to come up as biased but imo courtouis is nowhere near de gea's level.

358~~~
He just gives us that extra confidence boost at the back that comes from being world class.

359~~~
Navas had a clean sheet again. How did Alpaca boy fare?

*whistles*

360~~~
More nonsense, this time from David James:

<i><b>'Romero a better Man Utd keeper than De Gea' </b></i>~

361~~~
Think it means in terms of communicating and that Ddg isn't the most vocal GK and not a natural leader. Unless this is another article that is.

362~~~
Not sure that Sergio speaks English yet, so the communication thing is moot.

363~~~
Didn't say I agree but that's what he's getting at.

364~~~
I have seen De Gea having a proper go at the players infront of him plenty times this season.

365~~~
Yeah, perhaps so. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Why do so many ex professionals spout so much utter nonsense?

370~~~
Sounds like David James was worried people had forgotten who he was. Better get on the internet and say something mental to give his name a quick bump.

371~~~
Pretty much this.

372~~~
I get the point he trying to say, but it's idiotic. Definitely just a case of saying something controversial just to be different.

373~~~
You do? What point is that?

To me it looks like he's looked at our stats, saw the clean sheets at the start of the season and based his opinion on that.

374~~~
Well it seems like he's saying that De Gea isn't good at the defensive organizational part of the game as Romero is, and therefore it affects how we play. I don'tr agree at all, and yeah he probably has just had a look at the stats and said the first thing that's come into his head.

375~~~
Has to be this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

What a stupid thing to say. Unless the title is misleading? I haven't even bothered clicking it.

376~~~
Nothing misleading unfortunately. The title is pretty much what James says. Here's the quote from the padded-out article:

As has been said, he's looked at the stats, and not the games. Did he watch Romero dive out of the way of Gomis weak shot at Swansea? Did he watch De Gea keep us in the lead at Southampton on 2 or 3 occasions? Probably not. He probably didn't watch those first 3 games either, or else he'd know 2 out of 3 of those clean sheets were practically effortless. Villa and Newcastle were muck.

377~~~
He's a fecking idiot. I was about to say thank you for posting the article, but I feel poorer after reading that, so no thanks for sharing your misery! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> *thanks bro, only joking*

378~~~
Oy vey. Watch the actual football David.

379~~~
What was he doing for the Sanchez goal??? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

380~~~
It went past him at about 500 mph.

381~~~
There is not a lot he could have done for any of the goals.

382~~~
Not sure what he was doing for the first. Don't blame him directly, just seemed like an odd movement. Other than that nothing he could do.

383~~~
First goal .. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

384~~~
He just jumped out of his goal while Sanchez was ahead of him. It's definitely a mistake.

385~~~
Yea first one was a bit strange as Sanchez's starting position was ahead of him so why rush out and leave your goal exposed?

386~~~
Seemed to keep playing short passes too often I thought

387~~~
Really poor keeping for the first goal.

388~~~
One of the United/Bayern-bromances of the day.

393~~~
Feck you Casillas!

394~~~
Outstanding save!

395~~~
Has Del Bosque even giving an explanation why Casillas still starts the big games?

396~~~
Slow motion doesn't do it justice. He'd have made a hell of an ice hockey goalie

397~~~
Best in the world.

398~~~
People claiming Neuer is still number 1 are basing this on his reputation. De Gea has been the best in the world for a while now in my opinion.

399~~~
Been saying the same for sometime but I think it's unfashionable. Mayber cause Neuer is more flamboyant but he's more erratic also.

400~~~
He's fecking unworldly. The undisputed best in the world at this point. Neuer isn't this good.

401~~~
I don't think that word means what you think it means.

402~~~
Well, I think he should be the undisputed best. He makes saves that no other keeper would even dream of getting close to.

403~~~
He had 2-3 world class saves there, even the last one he catches. Incredible how good he is.

Neuer vs De Gea is the new Messi vs Ronaldo, i wont get sucked into it.

404~~~
True. But I still think Neuer dominates his area and defence better. De Gea is the better shot stopper though.

405~~~
So this is the second time we've had the "best in the world" and again will end up in Madrid. feck that.

406~~~
Saying he's the "undisputed" best is beyond daft, as that would mean no other keeper comes close, which is laughable. No issues saying he's better than Neuer, he probably is, but is the gap that much? Hardly

407~~~
He's an outrageous shot stopper. One of the best I've ever seen.

There are areas where Neuer is still stronger but De Gea is still improving and if I had the choice between either, with Dave's age I'd pick him. The annoying thing is when people compare keepers like Courtois or Lloris to either of them. The gap between those two and the rest is as big as the gap between Messi/Ronaldo and the rest.

408~~~
Come on, Courtois has stalled a bit but he is also very young, and has already had huge dominant spells. De Gea has been better than him and Neuer for a whole year maybe, which obviously accounts for something, but he isn't really that much better than any of those two. Next year it could be anyone.

409~~~
He isn't better than Neuer, people are getting carried away. Neuer is in a class of his own.

He's closer to Courtois but I wouldn't say he's much better than him either.

410~~~
I'd be shocked if he does not get the no.1 spot for the Euro. He is just massive and been in the form of his life

411~~~
How isn't he better then Courtois? De Gea has been pretty much untouchable over the past year and a half. Also compared to Neuer... He's made less errors then him, while being the best shot stopper around and pretty great in just about anything else. Him and Neuer are overall a level above anyone else as keepers, but De Gea has probably been more consistent (along with being tested a lot more).

412~~~
De Gea reveals the toughest finisher he has faced.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Features/2015/Oct/de-gea-names-fastest-toughest-fittest-players-best-finishers-passers-played-with-and-against.aspx?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...=facebook&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd</a>

De Gea: "He's so good, even he doesn't know which way he is going to go."

413~~~
De Gea has been comfortably better than Courtois and Neuer in the last two years. It's just lazy posting at this time to state that he isn't better than both of them. To say Neuer is in a class of his own is also wrong.

414~~~
He is, without a doubt, better at this age than Neuer was.

415~~~
De Gea has been sensational for us but he hasn't been at the same level for Spain up until now. He's only played sporadically which doesn't help but he has been more error prone. Even yesterday he nearly gifted Ukraine a goal by trying to come out and punch a ball outside the 6 yard box which on another day would've landed at a Ukranian for a tap in to an empty box.

So Neuer has that in his favour. That said I do think people like Vato don't recognise just how good he's been for us in the last two years. Last year in particular. There are probably only a couple of seasons in the last 50 years that a keeper has performed at that level for us.

416~~~
Was about to post the video of his performance against Ukraine, what a match it has been for him.

417~~~
It really is baffling how Casillas still gets the nod over him.

418~~~
Thing is, Neuer does it as well. When we've won 2-0 against Germany, first goal came basically from his 'empty flight' when he tried to punch the ball away. With Neuer it just doesn't get highlighted due to the hype, it's just like this bullhsit that he 'completly changed GKs style' almost as if he invented fire.

419~~~
Neil makes quite a it of mistakes, his teams are not punished for, so they are overlooked.

420~~~
Absolutely. I think it's accepted that Neuer is actually more error prone in the air than De Gea at this stage. He does take more risks and dominate the area more often though. De Gea is very competent when he comes out to collect crosses nowadays but he chooses when to come out very wisely. Neuer relieves the pressure from his defenders more often. 

I just meant he has consistently excellent performances in the national team in his favour. De Gea doesn't yet. I personally do think Neuer is an innovative goalkeeper in much the same way De Gea is. Not only are they brilliant at what they do but they have very distinctive styles which set them apart from previous great keepers - Neuer with his sweeper keeping and De Gea with his ridiculous feet saves.

421~~~
Aye, agree regarding the national team.

422~~~
Rafael the fittest player he's played with?

423~~~
It got highlighted for a long time actually. He built up enough credit through consistent performances overall and great performances in key moments for club and country. So when he makes a mistake now or has a few weeks of below par form, it's seen as an outlier and not held against him. Which makes sense after so many incredible performances over the last 8 years.

Did you actually watch Neuer at Schalke? I still remember the 09/10 season incredibly well, when Neuer kept Schalke in the race for the league on a weekly basis with out of this world performances. Schalke was level on points with Bayern with 2 games left. And Magath, Schalke's manager at the time, reminded the journalists every week that the goalkeeper is part of the team and that they should stop saying they didn't deserve to win because the other team created much more in the game and if not for Neuer Schalke would have lost.

Neuer was destined for greatness back then, it was obvious and the following years were no surprise to anyone who actually followed him at Schalke and at the youth nationalteams. It looks like the same is true for De Gea.

424~~~
Agree with this.

As good as he was yesterday for Spain (and he was really good) it looks that he is more like the De Gea of the first two years at United when he plays for them. He doesn't look near as much as confident and yesterday he punched a few crosses which for us he would have caught.

Still, I think that the confidence will increase with each match. Del Bosque will be a fool if he continues with Casillas, especially after De Gea's performance yesterday.

425~~~
Is it fair on De Gea that he's been forced to rotate with a keeper he's way better than. I can't see him translating club form for country as long as this farce continues.

426~~~
De Gea is arguably the best keeper in the world now, and at the very worst case, the second best. Neuer wasn't the best keeper in Germany back then IMO. As good as he was, Adler was even better than him.

At the moment, I don't think that there is much between Neuer and De Gea. Neuer is better at organizing the defense (which may be linked to his leadership) and at sweeping, De Gea is better at shot stopping and is less error-prone. Both fantastic at passing.

De Gea now vs Neuer 4-5 years ago? IMO, it is not even a match. However, it needs to be said that De Gea's progress has been quite linear (each season improving a bit) while Neuer at some point in 2011-2012 jumped from a very good people to the best in the world within half a year or so.

427~~~
That's simply not true. Adler was still favoured by Löw (which means nothing, just like Del Bosque prefering Casillas doesn't mean anything today) but Neuer definitely surpassed him without a doubt in the 09/10 season.

Neuer was already voted the best Bundesliga goalkeeper in his debut season in 06/07. In 2008 many fans argued that Neuer should have been part of the Euro squad after his fantastic performances in the league and his heroics in the CL against Porto. He followed it up with another great season for Schalke and the outstanding performances in the u21 Euro win 2009.

Be honest, how often did you watch Neuer before the CL semifinals against United? Because that comment is really really untrue. Many football fans in Germany already called him the best keeper in the world in 2010 and 2011, similar to how United fans now see De Gea already as the best in the world even though the rest of the world doesn't agree with it, at all. For example, the telegraph posted a Euro 2016 dream squad today and the 3 goalkeepers were Neuer, Courtois and Hart.

428~~~
In terms of shot stopping, nobody comes close. As the full package, I suppose it's daft to say he should be the undisputed best. I think shot stopping is obviously the most valuable attribute for a keeper to have though. Defense organisation, kicking ect all come secondary.

429~~~
This is one of those situations where people just decide something in their head and then stick with it no matter what, probably based on little more than media and video games. I don't really understand how anyone could watch the three of those goalkeepers and think that Neuer is 'in a class of his own'. De Gea has out-performed those two now for pretty much 18 months, comfortably.

430~~~
Well, I'll give you that. I haven't watched Bundesliga near as much as you. Both Neuer and Adler impressed me most of the time when I watched them, but read that Adler was more rated and so was playing for the national team. Unlike, Casillas-De Gea case, neither of them were a legend on his country (which I think is the reason why Casillas still play for Spain)

Fair point. The last line is funny though. An English paper/website having an English keeper in top 3. Who would have though?

It illustrates your point good enough though.

431~~~
Different reason of course, but it was a really weird time for German goalkeepers. Lehmann still played in 2008 even though he shouldn't have. Then he retired, Enke became first choice with Adler 2nd choice and Neuer was still a u21 player. So instead of being just part of the senior squad, he continued his career in the u21. I understood that decision and Neuer proved his worth in the u21 Euro winning side. Then Enke commited suicide and instead of questioning all the rankings, Löw just moved on to the next in line. Again, difficult to hold it against Löw or Neuer with what just happened. And Adler performed well, he was clearly a fantastic shotstopper before injuries ruined his career. Then Adler's injury ahead of the WC sorted the problem for Löw and we never looked back.

It's not like Neuer had to wait inline forever behind a clearly inferior goalkeeper or anything like that. He went from winning the u21 Euro in 2009 to starting at the World Cup in 2010. You can't move up faster than that as a goalkeeper.

I think it's mental. If you want to force an English goalkeeper into the squad, then leave Courtois out. At least in England, everyone should have realised how brilliant De Gea was over the last 2 years. But yeah, like you say, it really proves the point that unless you watch a goalkeeper week in, week out, you can't really judge him. Making crazy statements about Neuer's performances 4-5 years ago is ridiculous if it's actually based on his global reputation back then and not on watching him every week for yourself.

432~~~
Really? That's insanity of the highest order, unless the argument is that De Gea isn't considered because Casillas might still start at the Euros. No argument about Neuer, but there's no chance De Gea should be behind Courtois or Hart. 

I don't understand how Courtois is still rated above De Gea. One or 2 years ago it was close and the scales might've tipped in Courtois' favour, with his impressive Atletico achievements. But last year both were in the Premier League and De Gea had a significantly better season, consistently putting in world class performances. Courtois had those as well but to a lesser extent and he made more errors than I expected. He might still prove himself equal but right now there's no legitemate basis to claim he's as good as De Gea, let alone better.

434~~~
Looks like it's based solely from international form, which is stupid in itself but not entirely surprising.

435~~~
Not sure about that. For example, Hazard is in it but De Bruyne isn't, even though De Bruyne has been way way better for Belgium than Hazard. It could be true that De Gea is left out because he's not a sure starter of course, but that would be silly, both by the media for accepting it despite his brilliant performances and by Del Bosque for playing an at this point clearly inferior goalkeeper.

436~~~
I only read the narrative for each of the keepers and it was all about their performances for their countries, no mention at all of club performance, which is what made me assume that was all it was based on.

437~~~
TBF, Hart has been in excellent form this season.

438~~~
They seem to base themselves on performances for the national team, which perhaps justifies it a little. But that's such a small sample size, I don't like it. Curiously, later on they include Hazard who is consistently underwhelming for Belgium and only shines at club level.

Edit: I see you were way ahead of me. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

439~~~
True. Excellent keeper. Think people fell into the habit of underrating him due to that extended bad spell he went through.

440~~~
Dave being Dave. Nothing to see here.

441~~~
Courtuis is a very good keeper, and will only become better, but really last season it wasn't even close. Not that De Gea was miles better than him, but Lloris was easily better than Courtuis too. And that is just in this league.

If the clause is 50+ Million then that's better then nothing. There is always speculation. Anyone can speculate. Heck, let's make it 60 million. Either way, if there was a clause, no one would know what it was. I wouldn't imagine it'll be exercised any time soon but he plays for his country and they're probably desperate for him to be first choice. Can't say I blame them. We're in a far better situation regardless. The player may have been professional but he made a dick move. Can understand his reasons but they do things different there. Not very professional.

446~~~
2010/11 was the year van der Sar announced his retirement, believe me that United fans were plenty interested in Neuer. I bet more of us wanted him than DDG as the VDS replacement, including myself. I'm not claiming Neuer was some no-name before Bayern, just that DDG is playing at higher level now at age 24. Also, IIRC Neuer was still making high-profile mistakes in his first year or so at Bayern and was sometimes guilty of not maintaining his concentration. That's not the case with DDG and hasn't been for years.  For me, that puts him ahead on the development curve.

447~~~
Come on. As if many United fans started following Schalke regularly because of a few vague rumours, which were almost instantly dismissed anyway. It became obvious soon enough that Neuer had already agreed to join Bayern.

Neuer made a few mistakes in his first season at Bayern, but overall still had a fantastic year. He didn't make many anyway, proven by the fact that our defensive record improved significantly and we had the best record in the league, which is actually a great indicator. Out of Neuer's 5 seasons at Schalke, three times they conceded the least amount of goals in the league. Once they had the 3rd best defensive record and even in the disaster season 10/11 when they finished 14th, they still had the 4th best defensive record. Since Neuer joined us, we've always had the best defensive record in the league. It's no coincidence and shows his ridiculous consistency over the last 10 years, but also how crazy consistent and influential he already was between 20 and 25 playing for a weaker team.

It's also not surprising that a player struggles a bit to adapt to a new team and a new playing style. That doesn't have to do anything with his age and you can't hold that against his individual development or say it nullifies his brilliance in previous seasons. Neuer also played again a fantastic CL campaign in his first season at Bayern, reaching the final. It was his 3rd with standout games following the first one in 07/08 when he carried Schalke into the quarterfinals through his heroics against Porto and the 10/11 one, when Schalke reached the semifinal.

Make it a fair comparison between Neuer's overall performances between 2008 and 2011 instead of just cherry-picking the few games that suit your agenda and you'll see that your comment:
simply isn't true. There's a lot of doubt about that statement. I wouldn't want to pick one over the other, because De Gea obviously has been excellent.

448~~~
That's why I like this forum. Lots of posters not just from Utd backgrounds making informed posts and opinions.

Great read guise!

449~~~
You've completely distorted what I've said (lol @ "my agenda," come on, get a grip) and thrown in things about Neuer's Bayern performances, despite my original comment only referring to their performance through age 24/25. Using defensive record and team performance is silly imo but since you opened that door:
- DDG, age 19, wins the Europa League with Atletico in 09/10 as their #1
- DDG finished 2nd in PL, on GD, in 11/12, at age 21 with a new country, league, and language never mind just a new system
- DDG won the league, age 22, was PFA goalkeeper of the year, and put in some universally lauded performances as United lost to Real in CL quarters
- DDG the best player on a United team in transition in 13/14, age 23, plays well in CL that ends against Bayern in CL quarters
- DDG again best United player, age 24, again in PFA team of year. Regarded universally as at least one of the best 3 keepers in the world
- 2x Euro u21 keeper of the tournament

How do you like them cherries? If you're going to completely dismiss the idea that a United fan might have watched a bit of Neuer and that we're just being biased, why should any of us view what you say differently? Have YOU actually ever watched de Gea?

They have similar trajectories through age 24. But DDG also undertook a considerably larger challenge by moving abroad at 20 and developing under the intense scrutiny of a club like Manchester United, not Schalke. That matters greatly and, for me, it's why de Gea is ahead on the learning curve.

450~~~
Agenda was a poor choice of words by me, something like 'fitting in with the narrative of De Gea's unmatched greatness at his age' would probably have been better. And no, I haven't completely distorted what you've said. I don't judge players on a single season and ignore how well they played before. If De Gea's form drops for a few weeks a bit and his next season isn't as outstanding as before, he's not a worse player all of a sudden. So when you say 'He is, without a doubt, better at this age than Neuer was.' surely we should compare a bit more than just a few selective months in their careers?

Anyway, I showed the impact he had on the defensive record of his teams in comparison to before and after he played there. That says quite a lot about his consistency and quality at a young age. None of what you wrote does the same. I wasn't cherrypicking, I gave context for his individual success. You did the exact opposite, surely you can see that? Also United didn't reach the CL quarterfinals in 12/13. De Gea so far didn't lift United to any relevant heights in the CL knockout rounds, which is something Neuer had already done twice at that age.

I regularly watch United games whenever they don't overlap with Bayern games in the last 2 years. Didn't watch that many up until Moyes took over. The transition of the team was interesting and since I started posting here regularly I took more interest in United. It got even more fascinating when van Gaal became manager. I'm not claiming I watch every game, but United is the team I watch more than any other, bar Bayern of course. See, it's not that difficult to answer honestly without dancing around an answer by saying 'United fans were plenty interested in Neuer'. But then I don't make big statements about De Gea that include 'no doubt' anyway, which is why I quoted you in the first place.

So now you're saying it's not the actual performances that make the difference no matter the stage (league, CL, international tournaments), it's the club De Gea plays for? I disagree, but fair enough, can't argue against that.

451~~~
Neuer is fashionable because Germany won the World Cup. Lots would disagree with that, but clearly Germany are smart and pick their best goalkeeper while De Gea has had to wait for inferior goalkeepers (probably because he's not playing in Spain). Munich fans wouldn't swap Neuer for anyone and United fans wouldn't swap De Gea - so what does that tell us? Both goalkeepers are playing very well and they are the best two goalkeepers.

Neuer had to win over the Munich fans but he has and Munich are in a good position. United were destabilized with Sir Alexs retirement but Neuer couldn't have done a better job for us that what De Gea has done. It's a pointless exercise trying to compare the pair but of course if De Gea had have won the World cup with Spain, it would be in favor of De Gea. Until United are challenging or Until Spain grow a brain, most of De Geas work won't be appriciated

452~~~
The only thing I think Neuer is definitely better at is coming off his line, he's way more decisive in that aspect. De Gea though is obviously confident in his shot stopping, which is the best in the world IMO. De Gea is actually very good at commanding his box now too, I can't remember the last time he dropped a catch, it's like he has Spidermans hands!.

Either way though he and Neuer are clear favourites for me. Courtios has the ability/potential to live up too it, but I would like to have seen how he fared behind this shakey Chelsea defence. So far he's been at Atletico who were solid as nails, and obviously Chelsea too.

453~~~
Not sure if we're allowed to post videos here. But he's tremendous here.

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

456~~~
World class, the best on his role.

457~~~
His footwork on that dipping Barkley freekick was excellent, good performance today that will go largely unnoticed.

458~~~
I hope to feck he stays. He's absolutely world class!

459~~~
Consistently amazing to the point you almost take for granted the brilliant saves he makes. I don't even get nervous when a shot goes sizzling in, he just sticks out his hand and it bounces away.

460~~~
Best player in the league. Aguero doesn't create enough for others, Silva doesn't score enough, Hazard is going through something and Sanchez is pretty great but Barca were comfortable selling him off because he's just an inch short of world-class.

461~~~
David de Hero! Still feels a bit unreal we still have him.

462~~~
Somehow a bit related, Navas was outstanding aswell. Made one of the best saves I've seen the last few years today. If he keeps playing like this you won't have to fear us to come knocking for Dave in the summer. Navas has been an absolute beast so far this season.

463~~~
You should be banned for this.

464~~~
Yea, because logic plays a huge roll in Madrid transfer policy.

465~~~
Touchy, mon frere? I wasn't wumming. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

466~~~
I wasn't serious... You've become an unfunny version of your former self.

467~~~
DDG, Jones and Smalling
Could be a new VDS, Vidic and Rio <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

468~~~
It's come to a stage now where every game he is doing World Class saves and we are like yeah good game. Carry on! He has spoilt us!

469~~~
Pretty much. I've lost all idea of what constitutes a shot that should be saved versus one that shouldn't, because De Gea makes them look like they all should be saved. The only emotion I feel is disappointment when something actually gets past him. A better shot stopper right now than VDS ever was, imo.

470~~~
You just can't give him enough credit for the way he has played this season considering the summer.

I always back him but I could also see the headlines after a few mistakes saying his head is in Madrid etc but he has been fantastic. Credit to him.

471~~~
Very professional of him. and to a certain extent credit goes to the way LVG handled the whole scenario. David too did not come out and say anything brash or negative  about LVG when he was benched. He did voice his concern but in a very professional manner. A thorough professional. Just hope he changes his mind about going to Real.

472~~~
Shaw a fine replacement for Evra too.

473~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I'm the same. I watch other matches and think 'wow, the 'keeper really should have saved that.' Of course then I have to remember that I am contrasting them with De Gea and so maybe I am being a bit harsh.

474~~~
Big Dave situation is going out with a girl who deep down you know is too good for you, and will leave you for someone better looking with more money.

You just have to enjoy it whilst it lasts, and prepare for your nervous breakdown

475~~~
Agile.

476~~~
He's his eye on the CL then <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

477~~~
Confident.

478~~~
Did his part, couldn't ask any more.

479~~~
That save was amazing, deserved better.

480~~~
Save before penalty was great.

481~~~
Phil Jones cost him a clean sheet for being a statue.

482~~~
Made no mistakes, played very well.

483~~~
Was his usual self. Felt for him with the pen.

484~~~
Dave 3 clean sheets in 9
Romero 4 clean sheets in 6

Time to bench this guy. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

485~~~
Feel bad for him, deserved better.

486~~~
Unlucky on the penalty. Was a good save and he did all he could.

487~~~
Unlucky at the penalty. Good game otherwise.

488~~~
Man of the match for me, great acrobatic save and terribly unlucky on the penalty.

489~~~
Saved us in the first 20 minutes.

490~~~
Motm I think. So good today.

491~~~
The only good thing about this team currently...

492~~~
Yep, Chris Smalling doesn't exist.

493~~~
MOTM for me, he's so vital to this team as we create so little that we need every defensive advantage we can get and his reflexes are a golden last line.

494~~~
Only had one real save, didn't he? The one from Bolasie that hit the bar on the way out? Was a very good reaction, though.

495~~~
Good to see him hand out a few bollockings as well. Deservedly so too. Some godawful sloppiness throughout.

496~~~
Surely he must be sick and tired of this crap we're playing in front of him all the time?

497~~~
MOTM. Thought he did everything really well.

498~~~
Man of the match without question, we wouldn't have even of got a point if it wasn't for him.

499~~~
We'd be fecked without him. Recurring theme.

500~~~
So good in one on one situations, he's saved us so many times, best keeper in the world right now.

501~~~
I knew Doumbia would miss. I haven't been this confident about a keeper since Schmeichel.

502~~~
He's at that level now that strikers are scared of him.

503~~~
Stood up when it matters, as ever.

504~~~
Good handling all night in the wet conditions and that save! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

505~~~
I knew he'd save that one vs one. That's the kind of feeling he gives you.

506~~~
Nothing to do all game and then comes up with a save like that. That's why he's world class and one of the best around. As good as a goal.

507~~~
Smalling's clearance was fantastic, but his save was insane.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://giant.gfycat.com/GlassThreadbareAustraliankestrel.gif" src="http://giant.gfycat.com/GlassThreadbareAustraliankestrel.gif"/>

508~~~
He's just so good. You can get complacent having him in net and take him pulling off crucial saves every single game for granted but it has to be reiterated.

He's fecking incredible.

509~~~
De God.

That save was absolutely absurd, but you pretty much expect types of saves from him - he's just that good.

510~~~
Meh! He just had a 'De-Gea' performance! Moving on....








......what a beast of a player. Brings stability to the defence

511~~~
I am genuinely puzzled at how good he is at one on ones. Incredible ability.

512~~~
Any other keeper and you're pretty much down. When you have Dave you know that he could pull of a wondersave that he has no right in saving.

513~~~
Nothing to do all night and when he was called, he answered. Best Keeper in the world IMO

514~~~
Sometimes keepers get extremely lucky in these situations by making themselves "big" but DDG's save was something else, it was pure art and fully intended.

515~~~
I'm going to be devastated if/when he leaves for Madrid <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>.

516~~~
that 1 on 1 save!!!

dave and smalling are bloody brilliant.

517~~~
I am in no doubt. He is absolutely amazing.

518~~~
That save was incredible.

519~~~
We're running out of superlatives, the only thing left to say is: 

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

520~~~
I think that he is better than VDS ever was. The instant Doumbla was on one on one, I was very calmed and pretty much expected De Gea to make that save.

521~~~
Closing in on 200 appearances for us. Doesn't even feel that long. Van der Sar had 266 in total for us.

522~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

That was Schmeichel-eqsue. Doumbia shat himself.

523~~~

I see he's dumped Edurne for Perreira. What a great upgrade <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

524~~~
They have a similar clothing style

525~~~
Pereira needs to have a word with Herrera to improve his look. He dresses like a 16 year old.

526~~~
A 19 year old dressing like a 16 year old. Shame on him!

527~~~
Wow. That's amazing. Especially considering one of his seasons had no European football (and we've had feck all domestic cup runs to speak of)

528~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Yeah, I should probably give him some slack - he's still just a kid.

529~~~
Welcome to middle age. That moment when you realise a whole bunch of players in the team you support are essentially children.

530~~~
Fact is, I'm only 23! Maybe I've already become an old, cynical man. 

But yeah, it is crazy how you can sometimes forget how young some of our players are.

531~~~
25 years old today. Have clean sheet Dave! Also happens to share his birthday with Rio who is 37 today.

532~~~
5 Premier League clean sheets this season, would be top with 8 clean sheets had he played over Romero in the first 3 games (Hart, Myhill and Cech are all top with 6 clean sheets).

Would be great if he could win the Golden Glove!

533~~~
It was his 5th. Would be his 7th if he played all season.

534~~~
I literally just edited my post after finding out just now, I forgot about the 0-0 v Newcastle <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Edit: I'm having a mare. It would be his 8th clean sheet this season. The list I'm looking at hasn't updated for this seasons games.

Romero has 3 vs Spurs, Villa and Newcastle.

535~~~
what's the low down on Real Madrid?  Any latest reliable gossip?

536~~~
Marca did an editorial on him a few days ago berating him for signing a new contract  and having to endure the hellhole that is Manchester. They actually described the place as a post industrial back water.

537~~~
Looked a little shaky earlier on with some balls into the box.

538~~~
likely got that from his girlfriend

539~~~
One thing I missed about his new deal because I was so chuffed just to have him here was his new wage which is rumored to be £200k a week. Surely that makes him the top paid goalkeeper of all time? Also it's more than Madrid were meant to be offering him.

540~~~
At least he deserves it. Such a crucial part to our defense.

541~~~
Yeah. I think Hart used to be the highest paid keeper before De Gea signed the deal. I know Hart was paid more than Neuer, just not sure if Valdes or Casillas was higher paid too. With Casillas' move to Porto his wage will have gone down but that wage agreement Valdes had with Monaco which they're still paying a big chunk of is probably hefty.

542~~~
Jesus. If he were to stay at United his whole career ( <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> ) he could quite possibly rack up 1000 appearances and go down in folklore forever. That must be, at the very least, a little bit appealing to him..

543~~~
After the Marid saga.

544~~~
Is the full interview knocking about anywhere? I've been seeing excerpts here and there all week.

545~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.manutd.com/~/media/3B5116EF30744D9981F46BA904C6D103.ashx?w=2560&amp;h=1600" src="http://www.manutd.com/~/media/3B5116EF30744D9981F46BA904C6D103.ashx?w=2560&amp;h=1600"/>

546~~~
We always loved him the bollox.

547~~~
We did, but he must have been expecting a backlash from the fans. Rooney has certainly been villainised for wanting to leave, and it took some time for him to mend that relationship. You could argue he never truly has mended that relationship. For De Gea, it was instant. His name was sung from his first appearance this season. I think that will mean a lot to him. Hopefully enough to keep him away from Madrid for another few years.

548~~~
Someone gif that save! Incredible!

549~~~
That smile <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> think he shocked himself.

550~~~
That was up there with his best saves. 

<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a>

551~~~
Phenomenal save. You run out of words when a player is as good as he is.

Not human. It's the only explanation.

554~~~
Unbelievable save <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

555~~~
Imagine we had Romero in net this season...

556~~~
To be fair if Dave had left we'd have had Navas.

557~~~
didnt hold onto it

558~~~
In a time where people are doubting religion, we're witnessing a god on earth.

559~~~
Shoot me now, but if he'd just come out and caught the ball prior to the shot he wouldn't have had to make that save.

560~~~
We're so lucky to have him.

561~~~
Worth at least 2 (or 3) points today.

562~~~
There's another two points he's earned us today. He's as important as any goalscorer to United.

563~~~
Usual De Gea performance. Makes a world class save or two. Also made his once a match poor clearance which we always seem to get away with.

564~~~
The only truly WC player we have now. He's approaching my love for Schmeichel. Please stay for another 5 years, De Gea <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

565~~~
That save from the deflection was something else.

566~~~
DDG vs Watford
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/5baj" width="560"></iframe>

567~~~
He's just brilliant.

568~~~
Those saves he gets when the ball is seemingly already on it's way past him are amazing!

569~~~
What would we have done without him. He manages to pull out worldies like this every other week

570~~~
Kicking wasn't on point today but his saves are just exceptional. Truly world class.

571~~~
MOTM for me. This man is superhuman, that's the only explanation for those reflexes. 
That deflection save was as good as any we've seen. 

World-class.

572~~~
He's not a human being, he's the goat.

573~~~
Everywhere you go, you always take De Gea with you!!

574~~~
Watford players were already celebrating before he made that save <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

575~~~
He's the best goalkeeper in the world.

576~~~
He's made a lot of spectacular saves but that was one of the very few that I genuinely couldn't believe he saved. It all happened so quickly I could barely comprehend what happened!

577~~~
I can marry him. I am a man and i'm not gay.

578~~~
He's had a few like that where the ball is already beyond him and he's got no right to be anywhere near it. 

The Torres one and I think Southampton (from the corner?) spring to mind. 

That today was up there with his best.

579~~~
I hate van Gaal's attitude to de Gea. Constantly plays down the importance and even the quality of his performances when prompted by the interviewers.

580~~~
Yeah it's infuriating watching that segment of the interview

581~~~
It's got to the point where I'm not even that amazed any more. He just pulls of a wonder save in almost every game these days, such a quality keeper.

582~~~
This guy if he sticks about will easily eclipse Peter and Edwin as our greatest ever.

583~~~
The biggest compliment i can give him is that he has changed what i expect in goalkeepers. He makes it hard to see the difference between a de gea save and a regulation save.

I think if he could be the best goal keeper that this club has ever seen.

584~~~
Wouldn't have won without his contribution today. 

Kicking was pretty poor.

585~~~
Comments like this about current players are usually crazy overstatements and a little ridiculous but this one is entirely reasonable. 

If he sticks around he'll go down as our best.

586~~~
I think that's the best save he's ever made for us, didn't see it until it was nearly in.

587~~~
It angers me so much because it is so needless. Why can't he just stand there and say "yeah, he was outstanding and I couldn't ask for more"

588~~~
Seems pretty obvious he's trying to downplay his role and importance in preparation for him being sold next summer.

589~~~
The save where it deflected off Smalling was sublime. Truly world class.

590~~~
Nah, in general he has a hard time praising players individually.

591~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if he isn't happy today with him because of his distribution, even if he provided some great saves. Which of course it's ridiculous, but knowing van Gaal probably the truth.

592~~~
His ability to stay focused in games in which he's had nothing to do is remarkable.

593~~~
DDG <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/D_DeGea/favorites" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">favourited a tweet</a> from Adidas congratulating Suárez for scoring his 2nd goal tonight. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Seems like he is over Madrid, great stuff.

594~~~
I only really watch Bayern's CL matches but for anyone who watches both Dave and Neuer regularly,who would you say is the current best keeper in the world?

595~~~
Jedi reactions. Keeping him away from Madrid is the best business we've done for years. Whoever made a bollocks of the midnight paperwork is a saint. Utterly irreplaceable.

596~~~
I watch a bit of Bayern and I have no idea; Neuer often does very little. It would be easier to tell if he had more to do, like De Gea does.

It might be so close as to depend on the team around them and the opponent. If you're playing a high line and dominating, you take Neuer and if you're a team that's going to give up a lot of shots, you take De Gea. So, maybe Neuer would be the choice for the very top teams and De Gea for literally everyone else.

597~~~
That save of the smalling deflection was amazing. He showed amazing reflexes to keep that out. With how few goals we create, he really is a massive difference to whether we get the points or not

598~~~
It could possibly be to show our performances in a better light, and not get drawn into the "De Gea saved you" viewpoint.

599~~~
I personally can't answer that, but I imagine De Gea lacks big performances in big matches which Neuer would have already done. CL quarters/semis/finals, World Cup, Title decider etc.

600~~~
I think is is it. Doesn't speak well of a team, when the Keeper is constantly being talked about.

601~~~
Van Gaal has praised him a few times I think. The Everton game at OT last season and the CSKA game a few weeks ago come to mind. He probably wasn't happy with De Gea's performance aside from that one save? His distribution was poor and he should have come and claimed the ball which eventually led to that save he made.

602~~~
I suppose if LVG never stops talking about him it will make Real lick their lips even more!

603~~~
Probably just because he is now sponsored by adidas.

604~~~
He could've favourited a bunch of other tweets on the adidas profile.

605~~~
I think he made the right choice not to come, he wouldve had to come through two players to get there and even then would've been stretching. This was a rare moment where Smalling deserves a little criticism for not heading it would for a corner.

606~~~
True I guess. I'm just not getting my hopes up.

607~~~
We wouldnt be in the top 4 if it wasnt for him.

608~~~
I don't agree with this logic.

609~~~
Yea well, playing without GK would be tricky.

610~~~
Adisa doesnt understand this point

611~~~
Hope he watched the El Classico and realized that he better stay here if he wants to have a shot at winning something <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

612~~~
Indeed and once Real lose Ronaldo or he stays there and declines they're gonna be Barcelona's bitch for another 10 years.

613~~~
That save was just beyond ridiculous. Best keeper in the world.

614~~~
"Oh shit!" Great stuff.

615~~~
Two brilliant saves to win us the match. Although I went for Memphis as man of the match.

616~~~
Never seen a goalkeeper with that sort of consistency as a match winner. Under Moyes all the doubts were if he could provide as many key moments if we were actually playing good football to and not conceding so many shots and chances. This year in the league we've conceded the least goals and have the second fewest shots on target conceded per game and he hasn't dropped his impact one bit.

617~~~
Aye, and that's what you want from a keeper. The ability to concentrate and stay focused despite not seeing any real action is what makes a top keeper.

I'm stating the obvious, I know.

618~~~
Missed the game but just watched the highlights. What a save of Smalling's header which would have gone in! In the match it was nullifed by Watford's goal keeper of a save of Smalling's header again, later on.

619~~~
That save after the deflection off Smalling was world class indeed. That was a reaction save of note and deserves to be Save of the Month in my opinion.

620~~~
Back-heel <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

621~~~
Shortlisted for 2015 FifPro World XI

<b>Goalkeepers:</b> Buffon (Juventus), Casillas (Porto), <b>De Gea (Manchester United)</b>, Navas (Real Madrid), Neuer (Bayern Munich).

622~~~
Casillas <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

623~~~
Navas on that list is also dodgy as feck. He was on the bench for half of the year.

624~~~
Surely a two horse race between Dave & Neuer. The fact Dave didn't play in the Champions League last year might swing it for Neuer though.

625~~~
De Gea was better than Neuer last season but it will all come down to playing CL football.

626~~~
Maybe a little harsh, but I don't think Vardy scores if he's on his line there.

627~~~
Yeah I'm a surprised it's not being said elsewhere but I thought DDG could have done a little better for the goal.

628~~~
Yeah, I think he made a mistake coming out as the angle was pretty tight already, and darmian did put pressure on the shot.

It's little differences though, 9/10 he closes the gap and blocks it, unfortunately he just didn't quite get it. Did well to stop ulloas shot in the 2nd half though.

629~~~
Gotta agree with the above, you shouldn't be conceding from that angel.

630~~~
Should have done better. Weak attempt to stop shot and make life hard for Vardy. Maybe he had money on Vardy to get the record.

631~~~
Disagree with the above, just a great finish.

632~~~
It really wasn't "great" though. Watch it again and see where it ends up, it's pretty much straight in the middle of the goal. If he stays on his line and he hits it the same way, he saves that 99/100 IMO.

633~~~
But good strikers react to what the goalkeeper is doing. De Gea made the right decision, forcing the shot. Vardy just executed perfectly.

634~~~
He didn't look up at the goal once, it wasn't planned he just hit it and hoped, and luckily for him it went in. When your lucks in its in I guess.

635~~~
It was his standard technique for one on ones, staying fairly upright. Looks lackadaisical when it doesn't pay off, agreed, but his percentages in those situations are awesome, so harsh to knock him.

636~~~
What is De Gea's percentage for one on ones?

637~~~
That's a good question and one to which a brief bit of google scouring to support my plucked from the air theory has yielded little fruit.
Nearest I can get is a backing of his shot saving percentage in the box, albeit not all of these will obviously be one on ones.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Features/2015/Apr/david-de-gea-edges-thibaut-courtois-in-opta-stats-comparison.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...hibaut-courtois-in-opta-stats-comparison.aspx</a>

Damn being called out on internet ramblings.

638~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Yeah, difficult to tell with those stats especially given the difference between the way both teams defended last season. Still, appreciate the useful stat table

639~~~
Just think it's harsh to blame ddg for the goal. Jesus, the guy has saved us so many points already and is making that claw out save, when the ball is behind him, his trademark. Nailed on for our POTY for the third year running.

640~~~
Anyone noticed his distribution has gone to shit lately? He didn't have much work to do with his feet last game, but still he gave away very dangerous ball, Schweinsteiger saved his ass.

641~~~
Vardy wouldn't have shot it the same way he did if DDG had stayed on his line. Could he have done better though ? I'd say yes.

642~~~
I think the forum members just don't like the idea that Vardy scored against us. Again.

Guys, we have arguably the best GK in the World. He made the right decision, but on the day, he was up against the league's best striker. 
On other days, he'd save that, but on Saturday, he didn't. No big deal.
It was a fantastic through ball to Vardy and an unbelievable finish. Had Martial scored a goal like that, we'd be claiming that we have the best striker in the league, but because it was Vardy, DDG has to be at fault.

I'm just glad we only conceded 1 goal.

De Gea has a catalogue of great saves

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/david-de-gea" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">David de Gea</a> has produced so many superb saves in his four-and-a-half years with <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a> and he cherishes one, in particular.

The Spaniard has picked out his denial of <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/juan-mata" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Juan Mata</a> 's <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4lrjYb-y68" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">free-kick in Chelsea and United's frantic 3-3 draw</a> from February 2012 as his greatest stop.

United had, moments earlier, completed their comeback from 3-0 down to level at Stamford Bridge through Javier Hernandez when Mata, who had scored an elegant volley earlier in the game, stood over a free-kick around 25 yards out from goal.

Mata's left-footed curler was headed for the top right-hand corner until De Gea managed to swivel his right arm around and palm the ball wide for a corner.

The United No.1, however, did concede a Mata free-kick the following season in United's 3-2 win at Chelsea.

De Gea's save was the first turning point in his United career.

"When you look back over a season there are lots of defining moments and key goals," he said in April 2012.



<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i2.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article10538227.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/GettyImages-154873673.jpg" src="http://i2.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article10538227.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/GettyImages-154873673.jpg"/>
De Gea was beaten by Mata later in 2012
"But, I suppose, from a team point of view, and particularly from a personal point of view, the fact the save was right in the last minute was decisive.

"It gave me a huge confidence boost as well and that was important."

645~~~
Simply a ludicrous save, had no right to get to that.

646~~~
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>Anyone else have a suspicion what season it was from before reading the bulk of the article?

647~~~
Holy crap I didn't notice that!

648~~~
Our most important signing of the summer.

649~~~
Him and Smalling, single handedly keeping us in the top 4

650~~~
This guy is incredible.

651~~~
His performances can be described in 2 words most weeks...

"Thank you."

652~~~
Where would we sit in the table if we didn't have him? 8th?

He was the difference yet again today. Immense player.

653~~~
Great save from Moses' one on one early in the game. His technique in those situations is so good, and so consistent. Never over-commits, but always seems to react well. Jedi reactions. You can't win them all (i.e Vardy last week) but his percentage in those situations must be better than most, if not everyone.

654~~~
Surprised he got MoTM. He was good, one of our best, but he spilled the cross that almost gave them a goal.

655~~~
I've voted him MoTM 6 times this season...

656~~~
He's got 3 from me. Smalling has 6. But they've basically split it since Dave stopped being a twat and came back into the team after the transfer window. Martial has got 4 too.

657~~~
Made some great saves, but also made his first mistake in a long while - dropped the ball from creswells cross and zarate nearly scored after Smalling volleyed it at his head.

Hopefully that's his 1 clanger of the season over. Apart from that though, fantastic as usual.

658~~~
Guess so. Just to prove your point he stopped Moses yesterday doing exactly same thing. Technique puts onus on striker to beat him and more often than not, as he doesn't make decision for them, they freeze and fail. Despite my criticism of him last week, I think Hart should consider copying DDG. Concedes so many 1 v 1s as he flies out Schmeichel style and can't react/makes it too easy for striker.

659~~~
He should have left us.

660~~~
Great saves from him today and one dodgy moment, we're lucky he's performing

661~~~
He's a spectacular athlete.

662~~~
The one where he got bored was incredible to get back for.

663~~~
This guy is just ridicilously good. Absolutely sensational overall, he wins you points.

664~~~
Give him 500,000/wk, I don't care.. He needs to stay and set a standard for others to follow..

665~~~
Keeping him was one of the greatest things that happened to us.

666~~~
We're wasting his time. I was desperate to keep him this summer even if we missed out on a £20m fee. I thought we were in position to kick on and win something this season and he would prove to be the difference at the top. But I was massively wrong.

667~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> he's too good for us at the moment.

668~~~
Don't think he would stay beyond this season, especially if there is a release clause. 

The only truly world class player in our squad.

669~~~
All you self pitting feckers! We deserve him as much as he deserves us. He can make the most out of his career with us than the other club.

670~~~
Sensational. This guy is worth his weight in gold to us at the moment. It would have been a cricket score if he weren't between the sticks. 
He's off in the summer unless we get new personnel who change his mind. Ancelotti would be a good start.

671~~~
You guys really needed to stay in the champions league to keep him

672~~~
Yeah, I think there was hope to keep him if we had a pretty successful season and showed we were back with the big teams in Europe, but failing like we did makes me pretty pessimistic about keeping him beyond this season really.

673~~~
How are we wasting his time? He has already won a league title and earns 250k pr week.

674~~~
Sadly I have to agree.

Years ago, Matt Le Tissier used to play for Southampton.
On a football management game (Sensible World of Soccer), when I looked at the values of Southampton players, they were all below £1M. Matt was the only £1M+ player @ £7M.

DDG is our Matt Le Tissier and it really does suck. Our one World class player and if our average form continues, I think he will be gone next Summer.
I hope he stays, though.

675~~~
He should be winning trophies with his ability. You can't blame him if he wants to leave.

676~~~
Even Dave can't beat the elements! Made a big save shortly after though, if he'd timed it wrong he'd have been sent off.

677~~~

678~~~
Good words to hear from Dave. After all that's been printed about us these past couple of weeks we needed this.

679~~~
No, he isn't. You're just blanking out the bigger picture and focusing on the immediate issues at the club. We remain one of the biggest clubs in the world and a big pull for players. We need to sort our shit but he certainly isn't "too good for us".

680~~~
First time I have come into this thread since the weekend, can't believe there's not a single post criticising the Stanislas goal. Was like watching De Gea of 2011. 

Along with a shaky moment against both West Ham and Wolfsburg which he got away with too. Not sure if it's complacency but hopefully he returns to as we have been accustomed to near perfect performances from him the last couple of years.

681~~~
And it was not like he was doing feck for the rest of the match. He was involved and made some good decisions too.

682~~~
Another shot straight at him goes in.

683~~~
Care to list the others?

684~~~
If he wants to leave in the summer, he will have my best wishes.

685~~~
Yeah, he's a clear weak spot in the team.

686~~~
Vardy against Leicester.
If people want to talk about him being the best in the world, be prepared for him to be held to high standards.

687~~~
So, we're blaming De Gea for that? Christ. 

I'm going to assume you've never played in goal before. Just nonsense.

688~~~
To be frank, he hasn't been that great this year. Not culpable in any way but he's been pretty average judged by his own standards. Wondering whether he feels motivated.

689~~~
Oh no, Jones and Young were the main culprits for that goal, pair of fecking clowns. But as I said, high standards. The shot was right at him.

690~~~
He should've done much better on the first goal.

691~~~
I did say at the moment. Obviously if we sorted ourselves out (as you said) then he wouldn't be.

He could have done a little better with the first Norwich goal I though. But his defence let him down badly to begin with and it's not like he hasn't saved us countless times before anyway.

692~~~
Could have done better on both, imo. He's saved us so many times that it feels weird slating him, but those are the standards he's set.

693~~~
It just wasn't his day. Could've done more on both goals

694~~~
Fantastic save; I also miss that version of Mata.

695~~~
It comes to something when your GK is being criticised for failing to save one vs one's

696~~~
What planet are you even on? A couple of pretty ordinary moments in the last couple of games and you come out with this? 

He's saved us time and again throughout the season... not looked but probably has add many motms as anybody in the team.

697~~~
Nothing he could do about either goal, his reading of the game was on point more than once though and helped keep the score down.

698~~~
The club is a mess, no one is going to blame him for leaving in the summer now.

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

699~~~
He's probably thinking "feck Madrid messing me around".

700~~~
Real are interested it seems. Probably gone in the summer. Just lucky to have had him one more season.

701~~~
At least this time we should be getting a fee more deserving of his quality.

702~~~
According to the Daily Star. It's obvious he's going to leave anyway though

703~~~
yeah. I hope we are not selling/loaning Johnstone. I was happy with what I saw pre-season.

704~~~
We don't deserve a player of his caliber, You can't blame him for wanting to leave if he does want to in the summer. A player of his quality should be at a top team which we are currently not.

705~~~
enough of beating up on United already lads. We made a big mistake with Moyes. van Gaal did sort of steady things until he lost it all this season.

We will be alright soon enough. Keep the faith.

706~~~
No bump? His header save and the double save was amazing. (or standard?)

707~~~
Another couple of top drawer saves again today, my MOTM.

708~~~
Great saves, fantastic performance. Rooney was MOTM though because he's English I guess.

709~~~
Quality saves.

710~~~
yep... we'd probably be in the same league position as Chelsea without him.

Similarly if they had Courtois all season Jose would still have a job

711~~~
Once again makes a crucial save, his concentration is superb.

712~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://puu.sh/mrXdp/8cc68599a4.jpg" src="http://puu.sh/mrXdp/8cc68599a4.jpg"/> De Gea was second in the GK position.

713~~~
Great for Dave.

714~~~
About fair. Id rate him above neuer but im biased as feck and can totally see why he's regarded as the best.

715~~~
At least the "neutral" international commentators also believe he's in the top 2 now. Took them a long time

716~~~
Thank you Windows for only using version 7 in Madrid.

717~~~
Just leave and fulfill your career ambitions. Way too good for this.

718~~~
He's fecking ace.

Can I nit pick and say he doesn't save enough pens?

719~~~
Seeing Mignolet play for Liverpool last night just makes me realize the importance of having a great keeper in a struggling team. We'd be far worse without him down the table.

He's such a calming influence to our defense, and you know that Dave's got this with most chances.

720~~~
the Man!

721~~~
He's just brilliant. The fact that he has so few posts in his thread indicate how good he is because there's little need for discussion. Was key today, don't think we'd have won if it wasn't for him.

722~~~
What a man.

723~~~
Apart from the Emre Can save, he did nothing special. Liverpool were just punting from long range.

724~~~
Best keeper in the world. Yes, i just said it.

725~~~
What a player, saves us time and time again.

726~~~
Yeah. It was like Alan Smith made him MOM as some sort of sly insult. They like 4 shots on target and all of them comfortably saveable.

727~~~
Thank God Real's fax machine didn't work!

728~~~
He's set the bar too high. Did he deserve the MoM? Can't say, because the other 21 players didn't do shit.

729~~~
True, but he still delivers whenever he is called upon.

730~~~
I wish I could give him a big hug right now.

731~~~
Our greatest signing in a decade.

732~~~
I don't even think its controversial. How can Neuer be better than this guy?

733~~~
What a man, what a bloke.

734~~~
Or it indicates how much posters love to moan <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

Class performance as usual today. Just a class act.

735~~~
I agree to a point. His kicking really is superb too though, and a very understated part of his game. Especially when he's under pressure. Mignolet shits it whenever anyone is within 15 yards of him, De Gea still manages to effortlessly stroke the ball towards Fellaini's head when someone his raining down on him.

He handled that terrible passback from Darmian well too.

736~~~
Man of the match and well deserved too, he won that match for just as much as Rooney did with the goal.

737~~~
"DDG was not a fantastic, marvelous goalkeeper today - it is only to be expected that he makes those saves." WTF is wrong with LVG? Seriously, feck me!

738~~~
who has the most EPL clean sheets? surely he is close to if not the leader himself

739~~~
if you read the full quote its not really that controversial. LVG is not very articulate with his words, we should also remember this

740~~~
United as a team have the most with 11 or 12. I'm guessing Romero was a part of 2-3 of them.

741~~~
yeh he was. which slightly pisses me off as it ruins De gea's stats <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

742~~~
He wants to say that we won today because we were good and not because DDG was fantastic...

743~~~
So I'm going to make an unpopular post

All his saves today were fairly standard except for the one that went off his heel (which was lucky)

He is the best keeper in the league, but at times I think people go overboard

744~~~
The one from Can (?) was a very good stop and the one immediately after that he swatted away like a basketball block was reminiscent of the Great Dane. 

I get what you're saying but I think it's more that we've become used to the saves he produces.

745~~~
I know that is probably what he meant, but he is just awful to the media. Just say that he had a couple of great saves, but otherwise we defended well. Nothing wrong with bragging a bit.

746~~~
Nah you're spot on, and it shouldn't be an unpopular post.

747~~~
Kept us in the game. My MOTM today. Despite great result we were shite today apart from DDG.

748~~~
If Mignolet were our keeper today, we would have lost the game. DDG is the difference between us and them now.

749~~~
I agree 

We're lucky to have him and he is the best but I don't think he did anything out of the ordinary today.

The Can save from outside was good but you'd expect any top class keeper to make that.

750~~~
Agree. But I suppose it goes against the narrative that Liverpool battered us. They tested him with many regulation saves (barring one) and he made them.

751~~~
Not sure what you mean by "standard".  If we had Mignolet would we have kept a clean sheet?  Probably not.  Cech?  Probably.

De Gea has raised the bar so high we have a hard time thinking about how fantastic a keeper he is.  His positioning in 1v1 situations is extraordinary. The shot that hit the inside of his heel and went wide wasn't just luck.  The double-save may not have measured up to his saves v Chelsea (Mata free kick) or Real (the kick save v Coentrao) but it was above "standard".

I don't think anyone was going overboard when they picked him MOTM today or best keeper in the league the last two or three seasons.

752~~~
I am not sure the save off his leg was that lucky. Maybe he was a little fortunate but he was good enough to get something on the ball. Put Mignolet or another 'keeper in that spot and I think it just goes through their legs and in. Got my MoTM vote. Mainly because the others were not that good.

A 3rd 'player of the year' in a row a real possibility?

753~~~
I'm struggling to think of another contender right now. I'd have opted for Smalling, but he's looked quite shaky recently whereas DDG has consistently performed. Apart from that though, I can't think of anyone else who warrants it at all.

754~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/NRKG7M0.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/NRKG7M0.jpg"/>

755~~~
While today wasn't a super performance by his standards, having someone as good as DDG really can be the difference between 3 points or not. I know there's no way to prove it but when I saw Cech against Liverpool, I thought for sure de Gea would have saved at least one of the goals that Liverpool scored. Cech shouldn't have palmed the ball for the first goal back into the box, the 2nd was probably unstoppable, and he got his hand to the 3rd.

756~~~
I only saw a bit of the post match comments - can't remember if it was Carragher or Sounesss that said it, but they said it was a lucky save, but if that's the case he's been lucky all season. He makes his own 'luck' by putting himself in those positions. (Can't remember the exact words, but it was similar to that). I felt that was spot on. 

Even the Lallana save - he made it look like nothing by rushing out and closing him down so quickly. Pretty much forced Lallana to make a quick decision.

757~~~
I don't understand why Liverpool were shooting from long range so much. It seemed deliberate but why? De Gea is our best player and very rarely beaten from outside the area. Poor tactics from Klopp.

758~~~
Reminded me a bit of De Gea's first(?) game against Spurs where they were all taking shots from miles away.

759~~~
Cech and Hart have 10. Butland 9 and DDG has 8. Romero has 3. So we as a team, have 11.

760~~~
Yeah I just checked the stats, Dave is 2 off Cech and Hart having played 4 games less than Cech and 2 less than Hart.

761~~~
He could go on to be a true United legend if he wants.

762~~~
The Spanish goalkeeper almost moved to Los Blancos last summer, but The Telegraph report he's now set on staying in the Premier League.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/spain/21189/david-de-gea?ICID=TP_TST_1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">David De Gea</a> wants to stay at <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en/teams/england/manchester-united/662?ICID=TP_TN_4_2_10" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a> long term - even if <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en/teams/spain/real-madrid/2016?ICID=HP_TN_5_1_2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Real Madrid</a> come back in for him this month. 

The Spanish giants will appeal a transfer ban they were handed last week, but if unsuccessful they will be unable to sign players until the summer of 2017. 

However, they are still able to sign players in the January window and they may be tempted to revive their interest in De Gea. 

A move for the Spanish goalkeeper failed to materialise last summer, with the necessary paper work not submitted in time. 

De Gea subsequently signed a new four-year deal at Old Trafford and <i>The Telegraph</i> say he will knock back any attempt Madrid make to lure him back to the Spanish capital.  



I want to believe.

763~~~
What's the situation between him and his fiancé?  are they still together and if so,  is she often spotted in Manchester?

764~~~
we need to start having a team capable of winning trophies for this guy.

he'll be up there with shcmikes and van der sar as our best ever and he deserves to win  more than just the 1 PL tittle in 4 seasons he has been here.

765~~~
I just think Madrid aren't really interested and he realizes it.

766~~~
Nah, I'm sure they're just as interested as last summer. Balague said a couple of days ago that if they get their ban overturned, their priorities will be Lewandowski and De Gea. 

De Gea wanting to stay and become club legend is not impossible, especially after his transfer collapsed last summer and we all know if was their fault. Maybe he just isn't interested in a return to Madrid anymore.

767~~~
They want De Gea as an ego issue more like. I doubt its an actual need as Navas is more than capable of playing there as he has shown this season. They really need to replace Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo, Ronaldo at the least. Thats not including Benzema,Modric who will soon turn 30 as well.

768~~~
What I mean is that he isn't a priority. If he was their first bid wou have come on the last day of the window. They were prepared to pay more for Kovacic than they paid for De Gea. Imagine that?

769~~~
I guess the general reluctance of the clubs to pay big bucks for keepers and the De Gea contract situations played a part in Madrid's low-ball offers.

As for the timing of the bid I agree it didn't point to De Gea being a priority (especially after they had already signed Casilla), but according to Perez, we'd refused to negotiate until the last day of the window (if I remember correctly). Don't think he was telling the truth as he's a muppet, but them waiting until the last moment makes <i>some</i> sense as by the end of the window, we'd have been more worried about losing him on a free a year later and I think that's what Perez waited for in order to get De Gea for less money.

770~~~
Despite the way things went at the last minute in the summer he has been excellent this season, we certainly have gotten his best and if he goes this summer I'll wish him well.

771~~~
Maybe I'm paranoid but I can see Real coming in on deadline day this transfer window just to spite us.

772~~~
If he hands in a transfer request or wants to leave, I really cant blame him.

773~~~
Best in the World! Hopefully the impending injection of Mendes into the club can keep him here.

774~~~
Top player and MoTM

775~~~
What a player, we're fecked if he leaves.

776~~~
Best in the world. What a player.

777~~~
The last Costa save was good but the others looked pretty routine from the glimpse I got of them.

778~~~
I voted him man of the match, but these days every standard save he makes gets hailed as world-class...

779~~~
Wouldn't blame him if he joins Madrid. We are on the decline and he is in the prime of his career. He should think about himself too.

780~~~
He is a God, plain and simple.

781~~~
Its not like Madrid are winning every trophy there. They still have to contend with Barca.

782~~~
That Ivanovic save, feck me.

783~~~
We would have been so fecked if he went to Madrid, like 7th or 8th fecked.

We need to give him whatever he wants to stay here for 10 years.

784~~~
If LVG goes, can we keep the goalkeeping coach? DDG has improved quite a lot in the past two seasons.

785~~~
waiting for LVG to dismiss his performance

786~~~
Fantastic saves again. Some great distribution too.

787~~~
Brilliant. Can't afford to lose him.

788~~~
That save from ivanovic was insane, he made it look so easy like it was from 30 yards out! 

Can't believe how fast his reactions are and how strong his wrists must be. Best in the world for me.

789~~~
Meh, it was 'routine', apparently. Feck me he was great today, as was Courtois.

790~~~
Feel like he would've saved Diego Costa's shot at the end had CBJ not blocked it. Was in god mode today with his goalkeeping. A shame the block made it impossible for him to do anything

791~~~
Wow...just wow...

792~~~
What's the latest on that Madrid transfer ban? Could be our only hope for next season. Either that or we appoint a world class manager and he decides to stay. If LVG or Giggs is the manager next season, bye bye Dave.

793~~~
Same. I only saw one replay to watch his positioning, but I reckon he would've saved the original shot.

794~~~
People were crying over Steele and then Woods leaving too. He's just a class act who'd thrive under any coach.

795~~~
Yep, De Gea has shown progressive improvement inspite of constant goalkeeping coach changes. We thought he might step take a step back after each upheavel, but it's yet to happen. Plus, Mourinho's goalkeeping coach Silvio Louro is a renowened coach like Hoek, and has an excellent track record too - he has trained the likes of Vítor Baía, Petr Čech, Júlio César, Diego López, Thibaut Courtois. David should be fine under him.

796~~~
The look on Ivanovich's face after DDG saved his shot <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

797~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Standard? Wow!

798~~~
That Ivanovic save was brilliant.

799~~~
Best goalkeeper in the world.

800~~~
There was nothing standard about some of the saves he was pulling off, top class.

801~~~
The fact that people are calling today routine or standard just shows how utterly incredible he is. We've become almost used to his brilliance.

802~~~
It would've been bad if any keeper let the first two attempts in. They were good shots, but he didn't have to move much. Great reflexes though.

Also, does anyone have a vine/video/gif of the save that kept it at 1-1? I turned off the match when they equalised, so I missed it.

803~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/8qy4" width="560"></iframe>

You see those goes in quite often... the power on the strike will beat the keeper and everyone would say "There was just too much power on the strike"... It's a super save

804~~~
I thought that save from Ivanovic's excellent shot was absolutely incredible - the speed of Dave's reaction (even in the replay!) was amazing...yet it's being played down as if it was all about Ivanovic's supposed "Zidane-like skill".

805~~~
Simple as this.

Should the gods allow it, De Gea will eventually enter the conversation re greatest keeper of all time.

806~~~
He's simply the best. You come to expect the saves of his caliber because he's that good.

807~~~
I saw Banks and Schmeichel in their prime, and De Gea is certainly in that class. I just hope we can hang on to him.

808~~~
Whatever chance we had of keeping him will be gone when Mourinho arrives and gets rid of his spanish mates.

809~~~
He is absolutely absurd.

810~~~
You not got the 1-1 save? And yeah yeah I understand that but they weren't unbelievable saves.

811~~~
I thought the Fabregas save was pretty good. It was towards his inside post. Done very well to palm it out. The Ivanovic was a good palm above him (generally keepers don't get beaten in those situations above their head because it's more natural to save those).

Anyways most games I don't even both thinking about De Gea's performance because he's just been bloody brilliant. I almost forget or 'don't care' about it. His level for us is insane.

812~~~
Can somebody explain how De Gea has an average rating of only 6.8 here?

6.8 Average rating
7.6 Your rating
30 Appearances
13 Clean sheets

813~~~
It's kind of hard to rate a keeper anything more than a 5 if they don't have much to do. Even just a handful of games like that drags it down quite a bit.

814~~~
I'm not sure about the premise but whether a "do nothing" game merits a 5 or a 6 but I'm quite sure De Gea has had only one or two games where he's had nothing to do.

I also have to believe that De Gea has more MOTMs under his belt than anyone else on the squad.

815~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLxxVMy57fk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

816~~~
As it is, I think he has now served his dues and owes us nothing.  We either sort out our act and start challenging for trophies or we dont deserve a player of his calibre.

817~~~
That was good. Lower saves are always harder, although Costa's shot was no where near as strong as the other two. All three were good saves but Jesus the praise for them is a bit much <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

818~~~
<b><i>David de Gea was set to earn £9.2m a year until 2021 at Real Madrid had he completed a move from Manchester United last summer, according to the Football Leaks website</i>:</b>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/09/david-de-gea-manchester-united-real-madrid-contract-football-leaks-website" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...d-real-madrid-contract-football-leaks-website</a>

819~~~
An absurd amount of money for a keeper, but in actuality, fully deserved for the world's best.

Please never leave, Dave <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

820~~~
You have the same rating as me. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> He's consistently a 7 due to his distribution and calming effect on the defense.

821~~~
Yeah my rating for him sits right at 7, which I think is accurate.

822~~~
According to the article he earns more at United.

823~~~
That is 176k a week... less than he is on here.

824~~~
I read somewhere it would come out to about 250,000 pounds/week, something to do with pre-tax I think. Regardless, it was more than what we're paying him currently.

825~~~
I still dont think our perfomances have much to do with  him wanting to leave.

I think he just wants go home and play for the biggest club in his homeland. Also, the Eduerne factor is massive. 

I just Fifa and the CAS can get through the abitration process in time before the end of the season.

826~~~
I just fail to see why he'd stay to be honest. He shouldn't be wasting his time playing for a club out of the champions league. 

Think we had our chance to keep him by showing we could compete but have completely blown it. At least he's young so if we can show some ambition he may stock around for a bit longer.

827~~~
He's almost certainly gone in the summer barring a miracle like last year. The signing of the contract was just convenient for all concerned.

828~~~

829~~~
Brutos = before taxes (ebt)

830~~~
So if Jose comes in maybe he can tell Dave what a bag of shit Real is and convince him to stay.

831~~~
Bad day for big Dave, I felt he should be keeping those two goals out, moved far too slow for there 1st goal and the header should have been a routine save

832~~~
I agree, not a great performance from him today. The first goal I found particularly disappointing, felt he should have kept that out. The second as well he could have likely done better with, but the fault for that one lies with Smalling. The sunderland player had a free run at the ball and DDG had to deal with a powerful header from close range as a result.

833~~~
Couple of good saves but like mentioned he should be stopping the two goals.

834~~~
It's no surprise that he had his first off day since god knows when and we lost.

835~~~
If we are not in champions league and looking unlikely. Then the small chance of him staying will be even smaller. Looks like we will get worse before we get better what a disaster since Fergie went!

836~~~
Mistakes happen but I don't think either of them were howlers. He has done more than enough to have earned tolerance of the odd sub-par game (he still made some very good saves today as well).
He has done really well to keep himself focussed and motivated after the transfer saga and throughout a clusterf*ck of a season. He will be one of the few to come out of the season with an enhanced reputation and I will be amazed if we manage to cling on to him.

837~~~
Can't blame the keeper if you allow opponents to cannonball it towards the goal from short distance with their head. If a bad day Sunderland would now be equal on goals with us.

838~~~
Can't blame him for the first goal. The turf around the goalkeeper box was in a bad state and a huge lump of turf came off when he dived for the save.

The second one would have been a great save if he pulled it off. We are used to him saving due to the high standards he has set.

839~~~
Well there's Champions League gone...

= bye bye de Gea?

840~~~
Yeah he didn't make any bad mistakes, just not as sharp as he can be. A shame that some others couldn't help him out considering the number of times he has saved their blushes.

841~~~
That save with his foot was one of the best he has done and kept us in the game.

842~~~
This needs to be here..  Shows what we gotta do and not fecking turn against your club.

843~~~
Definitely beats casting doubts on our top 4 chances. We are 6 points behind but given the topsy turvy nature at the top of the league right now, it should go right down the wire, provided we don't give up that is.

844~~~
That does not look like a street in Manchester. She was probably showing him houses in Madrid for Valentine's.

845~~~
That face though.

846~~~
Even after all the replays I couldn't really tell what happened with the 2nd goal.  Not sure if he was at fault or just unlucky.

847~~~

Going by his playing career, Romero is right up his alley of goalkeeper, no surprises there.

849~~~
Please dear God don't be injured Dave!!

850~~~
Fuuuuuck

851~~~
Just saw the replay on BT, what the hell happened?

852~~~
Eh relax, the great David James says Romero is better. 

Good thing the Shrewsbury game is this weekend and not the Arsenal one. He should hopefully be back for Arsenal.

853~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

854~~~
Holy shit. He's out of the game. The hell...?

855~~~
What does that mean for the lineup game? (asking the important questions)

856~~~
If we beat Arsenal it's a Christmas miracle anyway. It's not even Christmas either, that's the sort of chance we've got

857~~~
Yeah that's one of those trendy streets in the northern quarter, trust

858~~~
#PrayForDave

859~~~
Ffs

860~~~
Deal with it.

861~~~
Fecking hell.

862~~~
Twisted ankle apparently.

863~~~
"Time to stand up"
Twists ankle...

Seems about right for this season.

864~~~
Any diagnosis?  How long he out for?

865~~~
I read on Twitter it's a knee injury. That sounds more concerning.

866~~~
French translation of LVG's post match interview mentioned a knee problem indeed.

Feck's sake.

867~~~
LvG confirmed it is a knee problem, yeah.

868~~~

869~~~
Hopefully.

De Gea likely to be back for Midtjylland second leg or Arsenal. Knee injury not serious <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MUFC?src=hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#MUFC</a>

871~~~
Let De Gea rest, Romero can have the Midtjylland and Shrewsbury games

872~~~
Let him rest. He's been saving LVG's job from the moment Louis came into the club. Now Louis can't mask our shit performances with super saves from Dave. Fast track to the sack.

873~~~
Maybe we'll address our CB problem one day and we won't need to rely on him so much.  Of course if he leaves, then we can't.

874~~~

875~~~
Great news

876~~~
Yessssssssss!

877~~~
Massive news.

878~~~
Offered a great safety net when the ball was lumped in, could do nothing about either goal.

879~~~
I was shitting bricks when the sun was directly on his face the last 30 mins.  Pretty sure he couldn't see anything and depended on our defenders for a change.

880~~~
That save against Monreal was a huuuuge moment. Was at 0-0 and he rushed out quickly. I honestly thought going behind might have crushed us, so it was a big moment. 

Was unlucky with the second goal as he produced a real good point blank save but had no luck on the follow up from Ozils mishit shot.

881~~~
^Agree about that chance with Monreal. 

De Gea, another chalk to his solid performances for us. It's fecking incredible.

882~~~
vital save early on. he is incredible, has always been.

883~~~
God

884~~~
He's the best thing to happen to the club in a good while.

885~~~
He finally gets the plaudits from all kind of people nowadays. The commentator during the Arsenal game said he produces world class goalkeeping on a weekly basis. That's just great to hear because for too long people believed he's still the same keeper as when he joined us

886~~~
I think he's recent upturn or just overall top consistency paired with Smalling's slight dip means he's currently our player of the season, for me at least.

887~~~
Saving us.

888~~~
Unreal how no on says anything about De Gea anymore after the game. He saves at least one 1-1 situation every match. Im probably too young to remember Schemeichel but I doubt Peter was this consistent day in day out. 

That fax machine moment will be looked on as one of the most pivotal moments in United history. If he stays here longer and we ever go back to winning ways.

889~~~
Such a safe pair of hands that he could operate on testicles.

890~~~
Routine job again for De Gea, kept us in the game.

891~~~
We owe him so many points..  Get a team going for him he deserves it so much.

892~~~
A lot was made of Eric in 1996 and how he won us the league. Far as I'm concerned, it was a two man job. Schmeichel was outstanding in a lot of matches that season and saved us, single handedly, quite a number of times. Without him and Eric, that team wouldn't have finished in the top 3 imo

893~~~
6.8 average rating. Really guys? I'm giving him a 10 in every game from now on.

894~~~
Would be a fecking travesty if he ever leaves us without us creating a great team. Fortunately I think he'll be here for a while yet.

895~~~
He's just the best keeper in the world, what more can be said? Who else can keep clean sheets and get us wins with a defence like the one we have in front of him, doing their best to give the opposition chances as well. Going to be a sad day when he leaves. Just hope it's not this summer as I feel like we might finally become a good team again next season if Mou comes in.

896~~~
Well I think there is certainly a room for "improvement" or equalization of his quality if we ever sell him, bigger keeper who is confident to gether balls from corners would certainly help big time today... Apart that he's world class and still one of the best keepers premier league ever witnessed

897~~~
Seriously, where would we be without him? He saved us in the last 2 games and basically most games beforehand

898~~~
Simply would have lost without him, he's worth a 100mill to us.

899~~~
One on one, the advantage is always with the striker, except if Dave is in goal.

I don't know how he does it. He seems to make himself big, but without <i>looking</i> big. He doesn't sprawl himself like Neuer does or like Schmeichel used to do. He just seems to take a knee to stop the nutmeg, and have his hand by his hips. His jedi reactions take care of the rest.

It's hard to believe the amount of flack he took in the first half of the first season here. He was identified as a weakness, which led to that game against Spurs where Van der Vaart was taking shots from the touchline.

I don't think he gets enough credit for coming through the shite he took, when the media were desperate for him to fail. Now the media are desperate for him to leave.

900~~~
Was a bit disappointed Mata got the captaincy over him. At least he got a 4 minute cameo with on it or so. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

901~~~
Strikers should know by now that placing it low past him one-on-one is like buying a lottery ticket.

902~~~
He's just so good, any other keeper would be getting more attention for saving his team yesterday, but with DDG it has become a routine. Just shows his class.

903~~~
It's got to the stage where I've ran out of lines to say about running out of lines to say about how good he is. He's not just ridiculously talented but his consistency now is incedible as well. Please don't leave Dave!

904~~~
Madrid wanted to pay €30m for him. Fecking hell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

905~~~
Thank feck the cnuts payed for their complete lack of respect. If they really do want him, they'll now have to probably cough up a Ronaldo fee or possibly even more.

906~~~
What's the highest fee for a player in his final year? Price was fair considering contract situation.

907~~~
Probably RVP

908~~~
I'd rather take my chances winning the lottery. I'm not an idiot. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

909~~~
No use commenting on this thread, appeal to close this thread. Our comments are the only thing more predictable than our play in december

910~~~
Mate, I don't bother using superlatives anymore. I've used them all.
I just say that he is the best GK in the World. 
So consistent. In about 50 odd games we play per season, he has 3-5 below average games. The rest of the games are usually World class. I don't think any player (bar Messi), can boast such consistency.

The other thing is that I read the RAWK and Arsenal forums. Their fans have also commented that the only reason why we can beat them is because of DDG. LFC fans in particular desperately want him to leave.
And lets not forget that he is our POTY for 2 seasons running and this will probably be the 3rd in a row.

Hopefully, if Jose joins us, he will remove any notion that DDG will join Madrid. 
If LVG stays, he'll probably get his way and sell DDG. He succeeded in getting rid of Di Maria. And would've succeeded in getting rid of DDG, had Madrid not messed their paperwork up. 
I doubt Madrid would make the same mistake again.

911~~~
What is this nonsense???

912~~~
I'd ask for double Ronaldo money for him.

913~~~
What utter rubbish!

914~~~
He'll have a release clause and the deal with Real will basically already be done. Does anyone honestly believe he changed his mind from his dream move just a couple of weeks after it fell through? Convenient contract for all concerned.

915~~~
DDG is the best keeper inn the world period..  Where the feck would we be without him? Utd with Mignolet where would we be with him in goal..

916~~~
Proven by his 6.8 average rating on here. Everything he does is normal. Saves a one on one, a close range header and a deflected free kick. 6 out of 10. He'd have to score a volley from the half way line and save 5 penalties in a row to get a 9 out 10.

917~~~
WTH? Crack kills man....

LVG has enough real issues, don't need to pile on with BS.

918~~~
This. He set bar so high that saving 1 on 1 seems like a routine practice for him, unbelievable really!

919~~~
Non transferable. we would be a midtable team without him over the last 2 and a half years. 100m, 150m doesnt matter.

920~~~
It's FM rating stuff. He saves us in many games but he doesn't concede many shots really. People also have different scales. Some have a 5 as a default, others a 6 (I do that). Conceding a goal he couldn't save anyway and having nothing else to do in goal will earn him a 5-6 from people. Nothing he could do about that really.

921~~~
Remember when most people wanted to sell him and the media absolutely hammering him and he was in a bad place after a few bad performances after joining us.

922~~~
Made a few decent saves against Watford but a couple of those he wouldn't have had to make if our defenders didn't play stupid back passes.

923~~~
Yeah, no ways he will be here next season with this shower of shite.

924~~~
Hope Mourinho coming will make him reconsider. He will have money to spend.

It will be a huge loss if we lose him.

925~~~
I think he's off.  

I wouldn't blame him to be honest if we are sticking with that flat faced Dutch idiot. Why change a winning team?! If it isn't broke don't frigging fix it!!!

926~~~
van Gaal is off in the summer mate.

927~~~
And so will DDG be!

928~~~
I know he could be off but even with a new gaffer and no champions league I think sadly Dave will be off once Madrid come calling again. Sadly.

929~~~
Let's hope Madrid haven't fixed their fax machine or upgraded from Windows 98.

930~~~
Are people forgetting Madrid have been hit with a transfer ban?

931~~~
Barcelona had a transfer ban too.

932~~~
It's been delayed so they can sign players this summer, I believe.

933~~~
I don't want anything to do with that over-religious Real GK.. Romero is a better option for the English game.


But Dave will stay, he'll stay and win trophys with us..

934~~~
We ain't winning nothing for a while yet pal, we're miles away from winning anything respectable atm tbf.

935~~~
change the coach and we can make easily run like Leicester who have much worse squad than us. It's a matter of if we get Pochettino or any other top manager in the summer

936~~~
It has been suspended pending the hearing of the appeal which is supposed to happen before the summer. Could still be upheld for the summer window then

937~~~
I just read that he's evangelical. Yea I don't want him at OT. We should push for Timo Horn of Cologne. Only 22 but a rising star in the game. 6'4 too

938~~~
Only player worthy of the shirt today. We don't deserve him.

939~~~
He's worthy eleven shirts

940~~~
would have been 3 or 4-0 with a lesser GK. Hopefully his heroics are not in vain.

941~~~
Poor De Gea.. I feel so bad for him.

942~~~
agreed. its like he is playing for the u21s

943~~~
It seems that De Gea is one of the priorities of Real Madrid (Florentino) in the summer. I hope he stays, but it wouldn't be a surprise if he doesn't continue with us.

944~~~
He's too good for us.

945~~~
He doesn't deserve this shit.

946~~~
If he wants to go, just let him go. Playing in this team is the worst form of torture you can inflict on an individual.

947~~~
Let him go. We are going nowhere and ruining his career.

948~~~
This player deserves to win trophies every season, clearly not going to happen with us.

949~~~
They were pretty routine saves. Not that I disagree.

950~~~
On the bright side there's no other team where he will get to do as much as he does here, amirite!? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

951~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/ie0e" width="560"></iframe>

Routine saves my ass...

952~~~
Awful finish from Coutinho.

953~~~
Mate, if they were all routine (or average) saves, please show me another GK who is routinely making those sort of saves.
No other GK that I have seen recently, is able to routinely make these sorts of saves.
And its happening in virtually every game, now.

954~~~
he will stay here so everybody can talk about him as the best goalkeeper in the world, our post fergie form gives him so many chances to thrive. He will not have to stop so many clear cut chances elsewhere

955~~~
he fluffed the shot but most keepers would have given it up

956~~~
It almost just makes me sad seeing how good he is, why would he ever want to stay here past this summer?

957~~~
I would just like to apologise to David DeGea on behalf of Manchester United. Sorry Dave

958~~~
We would already be out of this competition if it wasn't for him. I'm delighted we've got him but in truth when your best player is the goalkeeper you know it's not good. If the club doesn't get its act together he will want out and to be honest I don't think many fans would blame him if he did.

959~~~
Makes me shudder to think how much further down the table we would be if it wasn't for him.

960~~~
Sad to say but he's way too good for us atm. There's no real reason for him to stay beyond this summer.

961~~~
Give him stable defense and in time he'll beat Schmeichel's and Van der Sar's records.

At times even as a keeper he burns a lot more calories than most of these half professional passengers.

962~~~
All I can say is i'm very grateful for De Gea, imagine how worse we'd be without him

963~~~
Madrid is a giant clusterfeck and they won't be winning much anytime soon but i still wouldn't be able to hold it against him if he decides to leave us for them, as we're even more ridiculous than Madrid has been lately.

964~~~
Seriously where would we be without him. Our best defender by far.

965~~~
Any gif of the De Gea catch on that pacy cross towards the end of the first half? <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> ?

966~~~

967~~~
Cheers <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> !

968~~~
David De God saves us again. Poor guy deserves a better team and a better manager.

969~~~
Fantastic again. Unstoppable free kick but dealt with everything else perfectly. His playing from the back was great too.

970~~~
Solid as always.

971~~~
Not exaggerating, we'd be in 10th if we had a lesser keeper.

972~~~
Good for us yet again today, the save from Antonio was an important one and a difficult one to pull off.

973~~~
So... anyone know the status of Madrid's transfer ban? When does it go into effect if at all? Surely the only way we can keep DDG.

974~~~
We'd be completely fecked without De God.

975~~~
In the unlikely event we did finish in the top 4, I'd once again put it down to the heroics of this man. He saved LVG's ass last season too.

976~~~
I might write him a card.

977~~~

978~~~
Can we all contact him someway or another and ask him to stay? It sounds funny but im dead serious <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

979~~~
I've been trying to find on the Caf the leaked documents but not the ones relating to selling de Gea to Madrid, but those which suggest that we already had an agreement with Atletico Madrid in October 2010. Has this been discussed on here?

980~~~
Bad error by him totally.

Overcompensated for the cross and left the near post completely open.

981~~~
Was an error, too bad.

982~~~
I think we can let him off with it he's still the best keeper in the world for me everyone makes mistakes.

983~~~
Inspired but watching Neuer yesterday, surely.

984~~~
That was poor... but then again not many other goalies would have kept that earlier one out, so swings and roundabouts.

985~~~
Pulled off some good saves but left Coutinho too much room to aim for for the goal.

986~~~
A right ricket tonight for their goal but he also made some decent saves. A mixed bag tonight.

987~~~
"This team doesn't surrender!"

Okay.

988~~~
He's crap.

On a serious note, he's had two off days against Liverpool* and we're just not good enough to overcome that.

*I say two but he was sort of hot and cold away from home (conceded a poor goal in each game).

989~~~
Which goal in the first leg was poor from his side? If it wasn't for him it would have been 4/5-0 in the first leg

Agreed that his positioning was horrible for Coutinho's goal which completely changed the game

990~~~
I could be wrong. Couldn't he have saved Firmino's goal, last week?

991~~~
An error for their goal, although he cops less blame than Varela IMO. Smalling should also shoulder some responsibility. You can't be too disappointed though, one mistake every 15+ matches is understandable.

992~~~
As should Mata, he was a fecking disgrace.

993~~~
Yeah true, forgot about him.

994~~~
One bad judgement on his behalf, doesn't hide the fact he has saved us, so many times.

Schmicks done it 5 times a season...De Gea does it 5 times a month

995~~~
He has saved us too many times (and specially in the Liverpool tie). Best keeper in the world for me, yes even better than Neuer.

996~~~
Give him his transfer.

He deserves better than this

997~~~
haha poor bugger, let him go home to Madrid. After every game he must walk past the pictures of Staam, Vidic etc and then turn around and look at Blind and gag.

998~~~
Nice to have a game where we win and hes not MOTM.

999~~~
David De Gea ready to stay at Manchester United because of Jose Mourinho

David De Gea is set to stay at Manchester United following reports that Jose Mourinho will take over at Old Trafford.

De Gea was minutes away from leaving United for Real Madrid in the summer, with only late paperwork issues holding up the switch.

A move this coming summer has since been talked up, but rumours says De Gea has been impressed by talk Mourinho is coming to United.

Top Spanish outlet El Pais claimed on Sunday an agreement has been reached an Bleacher Report says De Gea will stay if Mourinho arrives.

It’s suggested that if Louis van Gaal remains he’s likely to move on, but a deal for the Special One is a game changer.

1001~~~
Holding onto him would be the biggest coup ever.

1002~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2016/03/21/56eff627268e3e11028b4670.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2016/03/21/56eff627268e3e11028b4670.html</a>

Marca say Madrid are no longer interested.

1003~~~
Well that's brand new information.

1004~~~
Madrid can take a flying leap and I hope the report of them not being interested are true.

1005~~~
Keylor Navas is a sensational keeper.

1006~~~
Yep. Best in the world!

1007~~~
Not really seen him. Is he DDG level?

1008~~~
Dave is IMO. 
I don't think he's as good as Dave but on this seasons' showing, you can't separate them on form. Dave is the best in the world IMO.

1009~~~
He's incredibly talented, fast and capable of truly spectacular saves in critical moments but very hard to say if he can reach that epic De Gea/Neuer bar.

Dave can win you a match but in Madrid usually it's all on Ronnie and few other galacticos to make that magic happen.

1010~~~
I guess playing at RM you need concentration given you'll have feck all to do for most of the match. Like how it used to be for us<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
Great news if Navas is looking class though. Anything to cool their interest in big Dave.

1011~~~
I know. I was just writing what I wants Perez to believe.

1012~~~
But...But... Balague said a few weeks ago they were back in for him!!!

1013~~~
If at the end of the season we manage to finish 4th, win the FA Cup, hire Jose and see LVG retire, it will not compare to starting next season with DDG as our #1.

1014~~~
Arguably as good at shot-stopping, both are the 2 best in the world in that aspect probably. Navas falls behind in other aspects though. Not as good with ball at his feet, and nowhere near as good in the air.

1015~~~
Have no words to describe how sorry I feel for Dave.

1016~~~
That's the thing. DDG is now such an all-rounder with no obvious weakness since he bulked up. Seems light years ago when he used to get bullied on corners.

1017~~~
IT is just a typical Real transfer market move. Pretend they are not that interested and tell De Gea that if he wants to move he has to force one and then Real can pay less for him.

1018~~~
Not trying to scare anyone with the bump, I watched the season review of last year this morning after work. Some of the saves he made were absolutely outrageous. The Liverpool ones, the Everton ones. Even an incredible body save against the Hammers. He is outstanding, go and find the review and have a watch it is scandalous really.

1019~~~
He's arguably the best keeper in the world, it's frightening that he's so good that when he pulls off a genuine WC save it never gets discussed but if Lloris did it it'd be talked about for days because it happens all the time with DDG, that's his level, be a shame if we lose him (though it doesn't look likely).

1020~~~

There is a De Gea montage at the end of this Hull highlights from the Moyes season and there is highlights from the Everton game and a DdG montage and some interviews from last season below.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/8daj" width="560"></iframe>

1021~~~
Dave <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1022~~~
Love how you considered peoples feelings but yeah, he's brilliant.

1023~~~
He's easily the best keeper in the world for me.

1024~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1025~~~
There's very little question now that Dave is the top keeper on the planet.  Whatever it takes to keep him, we must do.

1026~~~
Well Katie, there has been way to many injuries this season and bumps like these make me paranoid sometimes.

1027~~~
True that it can make you nervy. But very kind of you regardless.

1028~~~
Thank you madam. We can all agree that David is a fine young keeper and toast to his shot stopping ability.

1029~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-3E1ulVmek?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1030~~~
He is the best around. Neuer is awesome, but he still seems prone to doing something utterly mental, and we occasionally see him doing something mental. When he pulls it off, he looks like a hero, but when it goes wrong, he's got egg all over his face.

De Gea is almost a polar opposite. He isn't eccentric or outlandish. He sometimes improvises using his legs for those low saves, but he does everything with a great deal of composure and calmness. A mistake from him is a rarity, but because of the standards he has set himself, he is often getting blame in the matchday threads for goals which are almost impossible to stop. Like the Payet free kick, which was insane. Or a number of close range shots this season. Goals that no other goalkeeper would be blamed for, but because it's De Gea, we seem to expect him to save everything.

Irreplaceable.

1031~~~
The reason why I cannot rate Neuer as high as DDG is that Neuer has a good defence and excellent team in front of him.
If he were to have MUFC's defence in front of him and a team who cannot score goals (he would be under incredible pressure not to concede a single goal) AND he did well, then I'd categorise him at DDG's level.
I don't like to involve God, but "De God" is an apt nick name for him.

I am hoping that Jose convinces him to stay.

1032~~~
He could potentially be one of our greatest ever players. He's that good.

1033~~~
If he stays.

1034~~~
turned down Neuer, makes it even better

1035~~~
I think he will stay as he seems very proud looking at his social media posts. Real are being linked to Courtois who has cast doubt over his Chelsea future.

1036~~~
He must have felt like one of those ducks in a shooting gallery for the last 20 minutes, kept the score remotely respectable.

1037~~~
Thought Neuer turned us down for Bayern tbh. That tweet sounds bollocks. Neuer is five years older- weird comparison. Why not get Beuer then DDG in three years later?

1038~~~
He must regret that last day feck up by Madrid. Surrounded by a shower of shite week in, week out.

1039~~~
Awful flap in the first half from a cross, made up for it with some good saves at the end to keep the score down.

1040~~~
Anyone got a gif of his save? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1041~~~

1042~~~
Not sure how I missed that, thanks.

1043~~~
He's amazing. Give him another new contract.

1044~~~
The first save on his front post just before Tomkins goal was audacious.

1045~~~
The save from the corner is not human.

1046~~~
Ridiculous.

1047~~~
De God.

1048~~~
World #1.

1049~~~
Give him what he wants..  

More than they pay Ronaldo, Messi, etc.. Ask him who he wants to keep/buy in the defensive line.

1050~~~
I was going to give him a 9 rating, but then I thought if that's a 9, I'm probably never going to give a 10 out.

1051~~~
David De Gandalf!

1052~~~
Any gifs of his last two saves?

1053~~~
He's unreal. A highlight reel of one season from him is better than a career's worth of highlights for many a goalkeeper.

1054~~~
We're not worthy....

1055~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/r1wy" width="560"></iframe>

1056~~~
Tonight is another proof he's the best in the world. How can a keeper that makes as many mistakes as Neuer be no 1

1057~~~
Superb. 

Seriously? Lets not forget how much support De Gea was given when he arrived. We could have easily got rid of him but the fans and coaching staff stood behind him. Now that he's arguably the best keeper in the world, all of a sudden we're not worthy? We're one of, if not, the biggest club in the world. We're more than worthy. Anyone who plays for Man United should feel privileged.

1058~~~
People don't really bother bringing it up now because he keeps doing it so often, but he's fecking brilliant. Best keeper on the planet.

1059~~~
Get a solid defence consistent defence in front of him and imagine what we could achieve. The dude is making saves he has no right to, and making everything else look so easy.

1060~~~
So true. When I watch other matches 90% of the time  a goal is scored I always think the goalie should be doing better.

1061~~~
Mad how he predicts where close range shots are going before they've been hit. So often he's already moving that way before the ball is struck. Suppose it's just anticipation and reading body positions if it happens so often. He's magic

1062~~~
As someone else said.

DE GOD.

Will be soooooo gutted if he leaves...

1063~~~
His reflexes are absurd. Had no right to save that one from the corner.

1064~~~
He is completely redefining what level we expect from keepers now.

1065~~~
Give him ten new contracts <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1066~~~
David de God.

Courtois to Madrid, please (other) God.

1067~~~
He's going to go down as one of the very best goalkeepers of all time. fecking unbelievable goalkeeper. Not a single weakness to his game, almost never makes a mistake and shot stopping/reflexes like I've never seen before. Without a doubt the best in the world at the moment, and over the past 2 seasons. Neuer isn't on his level.

1068~~~
Think Del Bosque has handled the transition form Cassillas to Dave very badly. A joke Cassillas is still getting minutes for Spain. It's even putting more pressure on Iker.

1069~~~
That save from the corner is one of the best I've ever seen.  I was already ready to hurl my remote at the wall until I realize it didn't go in.  

Once in a generation type GK.

1070~~~
Not to mention the money we're paying him for the privilege. Think he is the highest paid keeper in the world now, ahead of Neuer and Hart?

1071~~~
In real-time that was awesome. It was a certain goal. Would hate to play against that fecker<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1072~~~
Enjoy him while you can lads.  Surely he's as good as gone in the summer.  Can't say I blame him either.

1073~~~
We will.

1074~~~
Best in the world. Ridiculous save from the corner. Im at a point where im surprised when we concede a 1 on 1 too.

Its unnatural to have reflexes that fast.

1075~~~
Is he on his way for another Sir Matt Busby award?

1076~~~
It's quite ridiculous now. A sackable offence actually. You wouldn't see the Portugal manager drop Ronaldo, if he did fans would be crying for the manager's head.

1077~~~
I saw a compilation of his saves. Just out of this world the guy is. Amazing keeper.

1078~~~
Probably. Would put him joint top with Ronaldo for most wins. He'd be the only player to have won it three years running.

1079~~~
He deserves player of the season again. Honestly he's one of the best goalkeepers I've ever seen. He blows me away every week with these saves. Miles better than Neuer.

1080~~~
Di not see Schmeichel but imo, he's above VDS. Ignore trophy count, this guy is ridiculous.

1081~~~
Out of this world. unbelievable save in the corner.

1082~~~
Paranormal save on that corner indeed.

1083~~~
He is ridiculous. We have to do everything in our power to keep him this summer and every summer after.

1084~~~
Should be the highest earner on the team.

1085~~~
Easily our most important player. Had we played with Romero this season, we'd have been midtable at best (11th-12th) and already out of the FA Cup.

1086~~~
He's undoubtedly the best in the world now. Probably has been for a while already, not quite sure where I see him going this summer, if Real even have a half arsed interest then unfortunately you'd imagine he'd be off. Fingers crossed they've got bored or turned their attention to someone else, I hear Courtois is unhappy at Chelsea!

1087~~~
Do you still get idiots saying he isn't the best in the World?

Surely everyone agrees now Dave is number 1

1088~~~
I think he's genuinely happy here but home is just an option that he can't really say no to. If Madrid go for Courtois and he stays I don't think he'll be that bothered.

1089~~~
Best player in the league.

It's a farce that he's not in the PFA nominations. Been sensational for us.

I think it's silly to say things like "where would we be without player X?" In this case, I'm 100% sure we'd be in the lower half of the league.

1090~~~
I don't even understand why Madrid have to go for a new keeper. Navas has been one of their best players. Their fans rate DDG highly but most of them think he would be an unnecessary signing and are very happy with Navas. This is just a power play for Perez. DDG wouldn't be as loved by their fans.

1091~~~
Madrid have been operating like this for a while now.

1092~~~
Running out of superlatives to be honest. Put a better, more organised defense in front of him (which the next manager might do), and he's perfectly capable of breaking Čech/ Cudicini's record for fewest goals conceded in a season. Maybe this is unfair to mid 2000s Čech, and turn of the decade Casillas, but we might be witnessing the greatest peak for a non sweeper keeper since Kahn and Buffon. If he does leave United (hope he doesn't - of course), really wish David goes back to Atlético. Won't happen because Oblak's been great, and David will command a big transfer fee + significant wages; but Simeone's tactics + that defensive line + De Gea would be fun to watch. And the way Atlético are improving overall, they're definitely going to get improved sponsorships and whatnot - to go with increased broadcasting money and the stadium deal, so affording big profile players like him might not be out of the question in the near future.

1093~~~
De Gea is comfortably better than Courtois, who probably wouldn't even be an upgrade on Navas. Madrid always want the world's best players (like de gea) and after embarrassing themselves last summer they will definitely want to make amends. I'd be shocked if he was still here next season especially as we keep regressing and he's not even playing regular champions league football, let alone winning trophies.

1094~~~
Dave is the top keeper on the planet, end of.  Whether he'll go on to be regarded as the top keeper of all time remains to be seen, but it looks a pretty good bet right now.

1095~~~
Neuer might still have the edge on commanding his area but DDG on his line is in his own league. He's in Messi/Ronaldo territory for me, in terms of making the incredible look routine. He saves, on average, at least one shot per game that 95% of other keepers wouldn't get to. If he was a striker, it would be like scoring a goal per game.

1096~~~
Had very little to do but made a good save near the end in a congested box.

1097~~~
Dave DeGod.

1098~~~
Supposedly made it into TOTS if you believe Twitter, if so, thoroughly deserved. Without him goodness knows where we'd have been this season.

1099~~~
Ought to shut up some Spurs and City fans who say that Lloris and Hart are better than him.

1100~~~
Neither are top 5 goalkeepers which should immediately rule them out as being as good as him, he's in a class of his own compared to them two.

1101~~~
Oddly enough I never see any oppo fans saying they are better than him. Only ever hear them cursing us for having De Gea or that he is 'too good for us'/'leaving for Madrid in the summer'.

He's undisputedly the best in England and his only real competition is Neuer.

1102~~~
I think Lloris would be in top 5 in the world.Although nowhere close to DeGod

1103~~~
I'm still not sure myself, he's very good though. I'd argue he's the second best in the league alongside Courtois (who's had a poor season in fairness) with Hart a little behind them both.

1104~~~
Lloris is often capable of some impossible-looking close range saves like De Gea is, but he does let in some soft goals. I've never been truly convinced by him as one of the very best.

1105~~~
Best keeper in the world so standard job that he makes the league toty.

1106~~~
Deserves to be in TOTY. Yet again, he's been outstanding. Yestderday was his quietest game he's had in a long time, which was strange as we put out a very attacking lineup.

1107~~~
Yes!

1108~~~
God.

1109~~~

1110~~~
The man

1111~~~
BEST IN THE WORLD

1112~~~
Laughably good.

1113~~~
Smart stop. Awful penalty.

1114~~~
Best goalkeeper I have ever seen.

The funny thing is, I knew he'd save it. He's just that good

1115~~~
He's ridicilously good.

1116~~~
Martial and him are the only 2 world class talent on the pitch

1117~~~
Seen better penalties, but that one is a goal 9 times out of 10. It wasn't in the corner but very firmly hit and most keepers wouldn't be able to get to it when it's that low and that fast, even if they did read his run, as DDG did. The reflex and movement itself was just insane.

1118~~~
Pay him £1m per week, whatever it takes. Just don't let him leave.

1119~~~
Him and steph curry are the best at their crafts currently.  He's that good.

1120~~~
anyone giving him a 10 today? Tempted based on the pen save alone.

1121~~~
He's right there with the best keepers I have ever seen.

1122~~~
This man is the best in the world at what he does

1123~~~
Yeah, or at least not very far off.

1124~~~
Best keeper in the world

1125~~~
This guy...

1126~~~
would've gotten my MOTM if it wasn't for martial. (harsh on fellaini too tbf.)

1127~~~
GIF of the penalty? <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> ? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1128~~~
Yep.

1129~~~
Wow, just wow. The guys a genius. Truly phonomenal.

1130~~~
Comfortably better than Neuer.

1131~~~
He's so good that nobody has anything to say about it. An absolutely measly 29 pages.

1132~~~
Gave him, Martial and Fellaini 10s! Thoroughly deserved.

1133~~~
He is the rock in front of our goal.

1134~~~
Shearer saying Lloris' name in the same breath as his is a joke!

1135~~~
Just a stunning stunning player

1136~~~
There's nothing more to be said.

1137~~~
Best in the world.

1138~~~
Yep they still couldn't admit De Gea is the best even though Neur has been pretty poor this season by his standards.

1139~~~
I wanted to reach into the telly and slap his stupid polished dome when he said that. Stupid bellend.

1140~~~
I did, he's the best in the world and comes up big for us time and time again.

1141~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/etyp" width="560"></iframe>

1142~~~
For me it shouldn't even be up for discussion who is the best keeper in the world. Such a clever, athletic keeper. Neuer seems to have a blunder every other game but De Gea just keeps on having stormers every passing week. Hopefully we find a way to hold on to him.

1143~~~
Give him a new contract and make him captain and assistant manager.

1144~~~
I always give him a ten. 6.9 average for the season is a disgrace!

1145~~~
Honestly he is the best keeper in the world. There shouldn't be any question of him being Spain's No.1 as well. If Del Bosque goes with Casillas he needs his head examined.

1146~~~
Best keeper in the world. Never had a doubt that he'd save the pen from Lukaku.

1147~~~
And part owner.

He goes down as our best keeper ever if he stays a good while, I reckon.

1148~~~
He is the best keeper in the world

1149~~~
Has he ever saved a penalty for us before?

1150~~~
In the 8-2 against Arsenal.

1151~~~
Saved one v Baines last season where we won 2-1 at OT. He made some amazing saves that day.

Also v RVP in the 8-2.

1152~~~
RvP and Baines.

1153~~~
Cheers. Can't remember the Baines one for the life of me

1154~~~
Didn't he save another this season but they immediately scored from the rebound? I'm sure it was in Europe.

1155~~~
Strong hand, great keeper. United need to keep him.

1156~~~
Yeah, against CSKA.

1157~~~
Great keeper and such a likeable person too.

1158~~~
Just an absolute beast of a keeper. He'll be so so much better than Neuer when he peaks if not already.

1159~~~
Was almost a carbon copy of the save today, strong hand diving to his right to one that was well hit but not exactly in the corner.

1160~~~
Not sure why it's even in doubt anymore. He's in a class of his own.

1161~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ce6stcruV7s?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Video shows how great he was in that game. Though by his standards that's an average day <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1162~~~
I was a huge Shearer fan when he was a player. He was the best finisher in the World at that time.
But to mention DDG with Lloris...Alan, I think you need to have a lie down. 

IMO nobody should be mentioned alongside DDG. He is the best, by a good margin.

1163~~~
Not far off who? Give me names please.

1164~~~
feck me. I genuinely think watching United over the past 3 years has desensitised me from so-called "great saves" from other keepers. De Gea comes out with impossible ones week in week out.

1165~~~
This. We have players performance posts well over 10k for some of them and the best player of our club can't even manage a quarter of that. What a bloody brilliant keeper. The best in the world and by some fair distance.
I am glad and grateful Fergie preferred him to Neur.

1166~~~
G.O.A.T (even looks a little like one too)

1167~~~
Running out of superlatives.

1168~~~
He's the best Keeper I've ever seen I think. He's worth at least £50 million imo.

1169~~~
When he retires, he has to be our GK coach no matter what. Doesn't matter if you can't coach the things he does, his mere presence will boost our future group of keepers.

1170~~~
It feels wrong to expect a keeper to save penalties but I do with Dave.

Fergie preferred  Neuer. It was Eric Steel who swung the decision.

1171~~~
Just build the statue now.

1172~~~
How long would this thread be if we didn't just expect him to be great every game?

1173~~~
Really don't want him to win player of the season because its getting a bit boring but yeah, its his in the bag isn't it. Next season, Tony martials coming for you!

1174~~~
Best keeper in England.
<span style="color: #ffffff">
hehehe</span>

1175~~~
Courtois is better, you should have a look at him in the summer.

1176~~~
Thank you!

1177~~~
Should be our #1 priority, again, to retain him and bump his wage up to that of the premier players in world football.

We would be nowhere without him, and he's doing all of this with a sub-par defense and midfield in front of him.

He's our best player and should be recognised as such in terms of pay grade and promotions.

1178~~~
But he made the final decision. So credit should always go to him. It's never easy to make such a decision considering how much more well established Neuer was. Ofcourse Steele played his part in that.

1179~~~
He is ridiculous. Inhuman. Love him to bits.

1180~~~
Pointless post. Well done.

1181~~~
eh, nvm. Don't really care.

1182~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Kind of wish Spain win the Euros just so that he can be in the conversation for the Ballon d'Or. Has no chance currently, with us not winning anything, but he's definitely among the best players in the world.

1183~~~

1184~~~
Providing he plays.
How ridculoUs is that?!

1185~~~
Awww.

1186~~~
I am pretty sure Neuer was our first choice but chose Bayern over us so we went for De Gea instead.

1187~~~
Nah. Fergie mentioned it himself that DDG was the priority after him and Steel went to watch him for a La Liga game.

1188~~~
Well I'm only going off what Fergie said.

1189~~~
SAF said he could have probably got Neuer from Schalke if he wanted but listened to Steele.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OMU-iSvJNGM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1190~~~
Hope he stays forever.

1191~~~
It's hard to come up with the words at times to describe his performances. He is just immense.

1192~~~
Best in the world

1193~~~
And then Moyes binned Steele.

<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1194~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1195~~~
SAF was also having doubts about him during his first season apparently.

1196~~~
Everywhere I read about De Gea they say - seriously challenging Neuer for best in the world. There's no comparision. Neuer always has a mistake or two in him. Watch him in a Champions league game and you can smell it coming if he gets too excited. He wishes he were as good as Spanish Dave.

David has been the best Goalkeeper around for three years now.

1197~~~
Honestly on this season's performance and last season, Neuer isn't even top 2 for me. Like Haddock mentioned, he does make quite a few mistakes and I don't think he's that good on 1 v 1's.

1198~~~
Best in the world. 

Imagine if he had a strong defensive unit in front of him as well.

1199~~~
He's the best in the world, full stop. Neuer is clearly very good and has great physical attributes, but ask yourself - how well would he have done in our squad over the past few seasons?  We've hung De Gea out to dry on many, many occasions. I can't believe that Neuer would have come through with his reputation in tact, let alone enhanced. It may be a pipe dream, but I sure hope we can hold onto De Gea for at least a few more seasons.  Brilliant player.

1200~~~
Please never leave us, Dave.

1201~~~
I reckon we could paint a Chevrolet logo on a brick wall and cover our goal with it and people wouldn't notice anything was different.

1202~~~
I am convinced we will keep De Gea <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> 
Navas is a fans favourite and to be fair Courtois is an easier option to get for Real Madrid if they want a goalkeeper.

1203~~~
Trophies. Neuer has won too many, but David hasn't. Until De Gea start winning a lot of trophies, and doing well in UCL and for Spain, it will be like this. It doesn't make it right, but it has always been like this.

If he was playing for Barca/Madrid/Atletico, it wouldn't have been even a debate on who is better.

1204~~~
Best in the world.

1205~~~
Tbh, and I know the whole "defenders & gk's aren't valued as much as strikers" bit is true - but I'd fleece anyone for much more than £50m, especially considering the market. 

He's still young & the best in the world in his position. Hell give anyone another 10 years+ easily. In a market where very good players & top potential are touted at starting prices of £40m....id demand huge money.

1206~~~
Back to back penalty saves vs Everton.

1207~~~
I agree with you to some extenet, but it's only because as you said yourself he's a GK, which is pretty much why I stopped at £50 million. Considering Buffon is 38 and has been the most expensive keeper for the last 15 years it just shows that clubs will seldom spend the huge millions on keepers. I genuinely think De Gea is the best keeper I've seen and when I think about it £50 Million doesn't seem enough when you look at the players who have gone for £40 Million + (D.Luiz & Sterling).... But keepers just don't demand those big fees. But if a keeper was to break the record it will be De Gea imo, he's still young and Neuer is 30 so he'll be retiring at Bayern.

1208~~~
Yeah, agreed. I just hope we didn't put in a £30-35m release clause in his contract <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Yeah, i agree. It's frustrating though. There's a few "good alternatives" out there but they're all a level or even 2 below DDG. Imagine we got £40m for him? We wouldn't even be able to replace him with a Lloris for that money <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1209~~~
If someone at the club did put a clause in the contract and it was only in the £30-£35 range, than that employee probably felt that was a good deal for the club at the time. If you asked me in summer how much I thought De Gea was worth I would have told you £30 million, but his performances this season is making his valuation go way north. I don't see him going to Madrid either, he was banging on about wanting to be a United legend a few months back... That fax machine fecking up in August is going to win United an FA cup <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1210~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> let's hope the FA cup and lots of other trophies in the near future

1211~~~
First time I heard him speak yesterday, after the game. His English is decent actually. Always had doubts about it, as I've read he had problems with learning it. Glad that's getting sorted, gives me more hope that he could stay longer.

1212~~~
For me he's the best keeper I've ever seen and I'm a huge fan of Schmeichel.. Dave is just too good at times.

1213~~~
Everton fans must hate him. Think that's two or three highlight reel performances in a row against them.

1214~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I can almost feel their frustration.

1217~~~
I feel sorry for hating his guts during his first season.

1218~~~
I thought that it was just the press who disliked him

1219~~~
Who remembers that guy who was banned, Kie-something, spent months telling everyone De Gea wasn't very good and wasn't among the top 5 goalkeepers in the league. Wonder if he's finally changed his opinion <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I swear there was also someone insistent that Craig Gordon was better and that we'd been robbed for De Gea.

We can't let him leave. He's the best in the world in his position. I don't give a feck what Madrid offer.

Probably would have had more records and trophies if he'd stayed at Atletico. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1234~~~
Sad but true

1235~~~
Maybe, there's still plenty of time here, we can hopefully reward him with an FA cup this season for a start.

1236~~~
Congrats, poor guy <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1237~~~
Name the East Stand after him

He doesn't even have competition <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1238~~~
There's no keeper in the league who's close to De Gea.  And only Neuer on the planet who's near De Gea's class.

1239~~~
Another brilliant season. Ridiculous keeper.

1240~~~
Honestly think he has surpassed Neuer now. Neuer makes a fair few mistakes, whereas De Gea rarely does. I can only remember 1 mistake of his in the last two seasons, which is the Coutinho goal where he allowed the angle for him to score in. If he was at Real, Barca, Bayern, or maybe even PSG he would be classed as the best in the world.

1241~~~
Well done, moron - that answer doesn't even make sense.

1242~~~
Well done David. Fantastic player. Kind of shows how we have been as a team considering out POTY has been a keeper for three years running

1243~~~
He has surpassed Neuer but hasn't been provided the stage to show it yet or confirm his status yet. Hope he slays at the euros and if we persist with LvG I wouldn't begrudge him his move to Spain.

1244~~~
Pretty much nothing to deal with all day but made that one critical save which is why he's top of the pops.

1245~~~
The club doesn't deserve him. He's so much better than anyone else we have its unbelievable. Would not blame him one bit if he leaves, he's been great.

1246~~~
Couldn't agree more. His celebrations when we took the lead were great, he really does care. Love him but he should be winning medals.

1247~~~
I will be happy if he leaves the club in 2-3 months.

1248~~~
Hopefully the buffoons in front of him for once have the decency to put in an actual performance vs Palace. He really deserves to leave with a trophy.

1249~~~
You can go Dea Gea, we won't be mad, just disappointed. He deserves greatness, not Smalling, Blind, Rojo and Valencia in front of him.

1250~~~
Let him leave. Have a nice career DDG, we will rot away for the next few years.

1251~~~
Should he have saved that 3rd goal? it seemed like he almost punched it into the net. 

Anyway we can't blame him. He should be protected far better, it's like a shooting gallery.

1252~~~
He was at fault for their winner I think. He's done more than enough for us this season however.

1253~~~
It was too hard at him(3rd goal) IMO. He did try to get it out, but the power was a bit too much for him

1254~~~
Imagine where we'd have ended up in the Moyes season without him. He should be running to Madrid as we type.

1255~~~
We can't blame him if he leaves.  If we go for Mou he might stay but can't believe he will stay with more rubbish being served to him.  We will truly miss you.. Ps don't go to Real.

1256~~~
how bowt the last 2 years aswell?

1257~~~
Players like him and DdG deserve to play against the likes of Bayern or Barca on thre big stage. Instead he gets to carry the likes of Blind, Valencia, Rojo, Herrera and co who are relentlessy grabbing and dragging him down to away ties in Iceland against gardeners and firemen doing football as a side job.

It will be a long time before we host a huge CL tie again.

1258~~~
I would be surprised if he is starting in goal for us next season.

1259~~~
10th-12th last season. Around the same this season or maybe somewhat lower

1260~~~
I'd be gutted but he can't waste another season under this idiot.

1261~~~
Bloody poor fella. Should be playing for a top team competing for titles and CL's every season. Go and spread your wings Dave we can't keep you down forever.

1262~~~
Wouldnt blame him if he handed in a transfer request. Hes been with us around five seasons right?

1263~~~
Thought he could have done better for their 3rd.

1264~~~
I'd feel sorry for him if he wasn't a millionaire and had a missus that is stunning.

Deserves better than this. He should leave if he gets the chance

1265~~~
Why would he put up with another season of this sack of shit regime we have? He deserves better but I hope that Jose can come in and convince him to stay.

1266~~~
I agree but on the other hand, he also kept us in the game yesterday. As people say, he's our only world class player (probably the best in his position). He most likely will move to a world class club this summer

1267~~~
He is going to feck off isn't he. And who can blame him.... with an abomination of a CB like Blind and a fullback like Rojo in front of him....

1268~~~
I think that's being harsh as we see him making ridiculous saves every week. I think it would've been a worldy had he saved it. Was lucky to get anything on it I think.

1269~~~
I love United and all but DDG could be playing the CL final if he had left. It's sickening LVG has made me feel United doesn't deserve a player. We used to deserve the best because we are the best, now DDG actually seem too good for us.

1270~~~
I honestly thought for a moment he was able to claw it out. It would have been a blinder had he saved it as it had a lot of power from a header 6 yards out.

1271~~~
And it's our own fault by hiring and sticking to the wrong managers.

1272~~~
I cannot believe the deal we did to get that shite Rojo. Vangle seriously is a lousy judge of defenders.

1273~~~
He has done us a favour by staying this season, never kicking up a fuss or trying to engineer things in the press and always playing well. July 1st we should drive him to Madrid ourselves for putting up with our shit for 3 years.

1274~~~
Would bring tears to my eyes if he stays. Would be unbelievable.

1275~~~
Took a deflection off Blind, then as was already diving couldn't readjust enough. Looked awkward but don't think he could have done anything.

1276~~~
If we keep lvg next season, or hire Giggs, nobody should blame him for wanting to leave United.

1277~~~
One of our most passionate players and he's in goal.  He was going mental when we went ahead as usual.  Means so much to him. 

Genuinely think he will be off now in the summer. What a waste.

1278~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1279~~~
at the lap of honour on Sunday we should have a whip round for his plane ticket

1280~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1281~~~
I expected him to do better for their third goal to be honest. 

Anyway, probably the best keeper in the world right now. I am a united fan, but even I would want to get the hell out of this team if I was there. Imagine having a teammate like Rojo...

1282~~~
Yep, agree

1283~~~
This. Lucky to even get a hand to it. Close range header plus deflection made it impossible. He did well to still react and get close to it. Most goalkeepers are watching that go in whilst their feet are nailed to the spot.

1284~~~
Think he did well overall considering he had bottles thrown at him during the game and a fan going on the pitch confronting him (according to the BBC).

1285~~~
Are WHU going to punished for any of the out of control fan behavior yesterday, or is it all going to get swept under the rug because RIP Upton Park?

1286~~~
FA are supposedly looking into things but think it'll all be swept under the rug, especially the bottle throwing in the stadium anyway. Not heard any mention of that being looked into.

1287~~~

1288~~~
Does this mean he is staying?

1289~~~
Behave if Madrid or Barca come calling and activate his release clause he's away. I have a feeling it could be Barca.

1290~~~
We still don't know this mythical release Clause exists

1291~~~
I like to think so!

1292~~~
Weird thing to do if you plan to leave. Then again, Adidas sponsors him and sponsors Madrid don't they? 

Still, he's such a tease if he does this and leaves. Please don't go De Goat.

1293~~~
Even if he was leaving there'd be no reason not to post that. One kit launch keeps United fans happy. Two kit launches just means more exposure.

1294~~~

1295~~~
That tweet reads like it wasn't written by DDG. Reads like marketing prose.

1296~~~
Means nothing, he's just doing his sponsor stuff. There's pics of Ronaldo in our 2009 kit.

1297~~~
looks absolutely delighted in our new kit anyhow

1298~~~
Last home game of DdG! Enjoy Madrid!

1299~~~
I love DDG but just want him to leave. We won't ever be able to reward his talent with the trophies if he stays. He looks like someone who enjoys playing for us, looking at his celebrations but we are forcing him to leave by not offering him CL football

1300~~~
I don't want him to leave.... Not by any means however it would be difficult to blame him if he wanted to go. I just hope Real don't see him as top priority with Navas doing so well and they may want to strengthen other areas.

Also he hasn't previously been linked with Barca so lets hope he stays. Hopefully he will want at least one more season under a new manager to see how we do...then he can decide his future

1301~~~
Could be his last game at OT.

1302~~~
Has anyone mentioned that this could be the last time he plays for Manchester United as the home side yet?

1303~~~
Honestly I don't think he will leave. Strange feeling.

1304~~~
Strange you want our best player to leave. Surely it'll be even harder to get back into the CL without him. Maybe we should celebrate turning into Everton.

1305~~~
This was edited on to the 07-09 kit, he didn't do a photo shoot like DDG.

And didn't the Van Persie transfer happen out of nowhere?

Anyway, I dunno what my point is because I can still see him leaving. Kit photoshoots don't mean much, they just got all the adidas sponsored players (besides Ander and Bastian?) at United to model their new adidas kit.

1306~~~
If Real come calling again - what reasons does he have not to leave now? It works both ways - if he stays and gives his best, he expects the club and the manager to give their best, too. 
Very simply put, we are not up to his standards anymore. 

Has been the best keeper in the world in three years of a shit team. We can't hold a grudge against him for deciding to move to his home town to his family, and play for a far better club with CL which can actually win trophies regularly.

1307~~~
I love him to bits but he is far too good for us. It would be totally understandable if he throws his gloves and leaves

1308~~~
Don't think anyone would blame him if he does leave, but just can't hope he does. Let's get a new manager and five new players and hope he can stick it out for another year or two until we are back challenging.

1309~~~
It's not like he is playing here for free. We are paying him more than any other keeper gets. I don't understand this 'too good for us' thing.

1310~~~
I hate the 'he's too good for us, we should let him leave' mentality. He's essential to our quest to becoming a top club again.

1311~~~
Don't see him leaving. The speculation has been minimal compared to last season. His re-signing takes all the pressure off us to sell. Navas has been excellent anyway, and Courtois seems to have had more speculation surrounding him. I feel certain he will be here come the start of the season. Maybe not forever, but I'd say at least another year or two.

1312~~~
I think he's off and I wouldn't put much into the contract signing - it suited all parties. Madrid know he's going for an already agreed price, DDG gets a big pay rise and signing bonus to compensate him for having to play behind Rojo all year and we don't have to deal with the constant speculation/Madrid's usual transfer tactics disrupting us/our negotiations for a replacement.

1313~~~
De Gea likely to stay if Mourinho gets <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mufc?src=hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#mufc</a> job but future less certain if Van Gaal keeps job <a class="externalLink" href="https://t.co/qkXmCa1r5c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/05/16/david-de-gea-future-at-manchester-united-in-doubt-if-louis-van-g/…</a>

1314~~~
He's off then. Mail are claiming Mou is in talks with PSG

1315~~~
How many more reasons does Ed need? Keep a frued and lose the best goalkeeper in the world.. Sack the Dutch bastard and keep David.

1316~~~
Mourinho, Ibrahimovic, De Gea or LVG

Tough choice

1317~~~
Don't give a shit about Mourinho, but if it means Dave is staying 'deal me in'.

1318~~~
Club deny there is a release clause.
Never believed we would put a £30m release clause on someone earning £200k a week. If there's one, I'm sure it's a lot more than that.

1319~~~
If only for the sole reason of keeping De Gea from going we should sign whoever he likes <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1320~~~
I believe to 100% that is true.

1321~~~
You seriously believe that? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1322~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> yeah its becoming that essentially. Yet somehow we will still drag it out and make it seem like a tough choice. LVG should have been sacked ages ago, yet it might come down to woodward worrying about his own reputation ahead of gettin ibra, a top manager in mou and keeping the best keeper in the world. Craziness.

1323~~~

1324~~~
Weird for 3 papers to report the same story at once...never heard of the Guardian or DM jounalists though so they might have just copied the earlier story

1325~~~
Who is De Gea's agent again?

Damn feckin' straight. This is a message from Mendes to Woody.

1326~~~
Nice one Dave.

If this helps in any small way to get rid of Van Gaal then fair play to him.

1327~~~
De Gea staying would probably cheer me up more than LVG leaving, Mou arriving or Ibra getting signed.

1328~~~
they are all lying. Trying to give life to their Mourinho to United story line. After the Sanches story blew up in their faces

1329~~~
Seems legit.

1330~~~
Once again, agent Dave to the rescue. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1331~~~
Honestly, even besides the fact that Ibra will come and De Gea would stay if Mou comes, he's just a much much better manager. I'll be fuming if we don't get him this summer.
We'll be a massively different team next season, for the better.

1332~~~
no brainer...but then our board has no brains.

1333~~~
Would be one of the greatest failures in football, like someone posted above;

Ibrahimovic (one of the best strikers of his generation), de Gea (best keeper in the world) and Jose Mourinho (one of the best managers in the world)

or 

LvG (who's made us worse with a net spend of around £135m).

Just looking at it there's no contest, yet I'm beyond petrified we may actually keep the latter on to save the ego of Woodward. Please make the right choice, Ed.

1334~~~
I agree with that.  Sounds like a power play from Mendes on many levels.  I'd tell Mendes to take a flying leap, no agent should hold the club to ransom.  We are in dire straits but if we need to get another keeper in, so be it.  LVG is another issue and he has to go, but no way will I let a player and his agent dictate terms to the club.  We already effed up with Rooney and his agent last time.  Ed learn from your mistake.

1335~~~
Kudos to Telegraph to come up with another nonsense article. In fact there is no as per sources or anything, just pure trash and then 80% of the article is not even about De Gea.

1336~~~
Either way, regardless of whether De Gea has said anything or not, decision day is looming ever larger.

1337~~~
That is all the press alone. Not even Mendes is involved I believe.......

1338~~~
Do see the agent thing (re. Mourinho part of the story) but if I were DdG then I'd already be thinking along these lines anyway Mendes or not. Would also be surprised if he didn't have a CL clause in his contract anyway, meaning he can leave if an offer comes in when there's no CL next season however long it still has to run. 

Could see him sticking out one season in the Europa league if there is some indication of ambition from the board and a glimmer of realistic success on the horizon but why stay at a cash rich club that just keeps flogging the same old dead horse? See Albert's views on insanity, and all that …

1339~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1340~~~
Indeed. Especially considering that there were words that we gave to David a few extra millions (the difference between his previous wage and the current one for the last season).

1341~~~
The report doesn't make sense. He wanted to leave last summer, what was his reason(s) then? Why did that reason change now to something else. I can understand fans that want LVG gone, what I don't get is the media that aren't United fans, that are so adamant for him to leave. One would think the English media will be in total support of LVG considering the english young players he has given chance to play.

1342~~~
Worthy of a separate thread surely..

1343~~~
On principle I agree.

1344~~~
It was never supposed to make sense. Just another media news with Man Utd so that people would happily click on it. LvG out is a popular opinion among Utd fans that they can play with.
A few days back they were pretty sure that the Mou deal was off because Sanches was not signed.

1345~~~
Maureen X United = unbelievable soundbites, press cons, clickbait.

1346~~~
Looked distraught after conceding the goal. His expressions were evident of how much he wanted the golden glove

1347~~~
Can't blame him. I felt distraught for him! Horrible way to concede especially so late in the game.

1348~~~
Frustrating that we conceded so late in the game. 

Anyways, not something to cry about.

1349~~~
Almost won the Pepe Reina award, I am sure Edurne will comfort him over this failure.

1350~~~
Looks like he's saying his goodbyes to the fans

1351~~~
I think most of us were distraught.

1352~~~
He'll be back one day. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before Old Trafford gets to host a CL final.

1353~~~
Go and enjoy the bigger stage that we can't offer you david. Stop wasting your years.

1354~~~
Jose will keep him sweet.

1355~~~
The best goalkeeper in the world and our best player. Been a pleasure seeing him develop like he has throughout the years. Hopefully he stays.

1356~~~
"Zidane tells club Navas is the goalkeeper for now and future"

1357~~~
I felt the same way. It seems that he really wanted the golden glove. It was the worst way to lose it, in last minute.

1358~~~
Played two games (Romero played v Midtjylland), but he still got named in the squad of the year for Europa League

1359~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1360~~~
Fantastic today

1361~~~
"Catch the ball!"

- Louis van Gaal to David de Gea minutes after they've won the FA Cup.

1362~~~
Maybe shouldn't have been beat for their goal but it was hit very well. A few excellent saves as usual, he deserved a trophy as much as anyone.

1363~~~
Loved his passion when he raised the trophy. Looks like he loves the club and he would stay if given guarantee of trophies
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CjAUT4RWYAEP9Hp.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CjAUT4RWYAEP9Hp.jpg"/>

Also loved Herrera being genuinely happy

1364~~~
Was there ever a keeper at his age with such talent ? Best goalie in the world in my opinion.

1365~~~
Someone get Tina Turner on the horn to sing her classic to him!

1366~~~
He was great again.

1367~~~
Obviously I'm delighted in general, but I'm especially glad we won today for De Gea.

He deserved a trophy after the way he's played over the last 3 years.

1368~~~
This has fallen down the list, tonight.

I did't rate him first season, thought he was hopeless, no getting back.

We have not been a good team this year, but get to 5th and win the Cup.

Is it 3rd season in a row best player?  I might have been wrong, innit.

1369~~~
His save at 1-1 was huuuge. Hasnt really been mentioned (was it from Gayle or Wickham, cant remember, not really important that part). Hopefully we see him with us for many more years.

Also his bravery near the end getting the ball in front of Zaha where it was inevitable he was going to get a knock.

1370~~~
Out of all the players he deserved a trophy the most.

1371~~~
With Mou coming in, it MIGHT be easier to keep him especially since they have the same agent.

1372~~~
I stuck by him from the moment he signed with us. Had full faith in him.

And David, you are welcome!

1373~~~
Love him.

1374~~~
I forgot about them both sharing that creep.. could work well for us in the transfer market, though.

1375~~~
Might? Can't see Mourinho letting him go anywhere.

1376~~~
#DaveStays

1377~~~
On pure talent level, this guy was a shade above De Gea, and the best I've seen live:

1378~~~
If someone triggers to supposed release clause then there's not much anyone can do other than try to persuade him to stay (says he with limited knowledge of how release clauses work)

1379~~~
He looked so happy, well deserved after that season. Best keeper in the world, easily for me

1380~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Cringe.

1381~~~
Looks like a man who is staying to me.

1382~~~
Oh DDG.. Even if he'll then play on other shirt, he'll get the same reception as Ronaldo at OT, won't he?

1383~~~
Absolutely

1384~~~
Love it. Even if he win more trophies with other club(s), his name will be forever associated with United.

1385~~~

That's what happens when your girlfriend lives in another country tbf.

About time he gets to finally relocate.

1388~~~
Haha

1389~~~
He's quickly becoming one of my all-time favourite United players. I think he knows he won't receive the same kind of adoration at any club other than United too <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

1390~~~
Let's hope Navas saves Real in a penalty shootout so Perez will be forced to keep him and leave our Dave the feck alone.

1391~~~
Yep if Navas becomes a hero here De Gea is staying.

1392~~~
So he is staying now <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1393~~~
Navas didn't even save a pen.

1394~~~
Damn, I know. Flopper might still be coming dave's way after all.<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1395~~~
I wonder how he's feeling now. Could easily have been him lifting that trophy tonight.

1396~~~
Enjoy guys.

1401~~~
I don't get why Barcelona isn't trying to sign him, Bravo is not the youngest and Ter Stegen is not reliable. He played 26 games and got 27 goals. His mistakes are awkward, like yesterday with Germany in their friendly game.

1402~~~
Think that's because he is from Madrid, and Barcelona dont sign players from Madrid. Said this in another thread as well, but it is very rare for Barcelona to sign a Spanish player who isn't from Catalonia or a graduate of their youth academy

1403~~~
Makes sense. ^^
Ok, so we're lucky.

1404~~~
Never realised this. Looking at their squad, they actually don't have a non-Catalan Spaniard in the first team, except the ones that came through La Masia. Pretty cool, that.

Who was the last non-Catalan Spaniard player they signed for the first team?

1405~~~
Is Iniesta Catalan?  Villa and Pedro?

1406~~~
I think Villa, but before that I think it was Enrique.

1407~~~
Iniesta and Pedro are from their academy though. Villa is an exception

1408~~~
Imagine if we opted against signing Rooney in 2004 because he was scouse/not a Mancunian <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1409~~~
He has made some brilliant saves against Chelsea throughout his career.

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>David De Gea: I want to stay at Manchester United and win titles with Jose Mourinho</b>
</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>DAVID DE GEA has revealed he wants to stay at Manchester United and work with Jose Mourinho.</b></span>

<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>
De Gea came close to moving to Real Madrid last summer but the final paperwork was not submitted before the transfer window closed, scuppering the deal.

The Spain international then signed a new contract at Old Trafford, however <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/675709/Manchester-United-David-De-Gea-Real-Madrid-Transfer-News-Florentino-Perez-Gossip-News" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">he has continued to be linked with a move to the Bernabeu this summer</a>.

However De Gea has now admitted he wants to stay at the club and win titles with Mourinho.

He told Spanish newspaper <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2016/06/03/5751367146163f21688b4700.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><i>Marca</i></a>: "Talk about Jose Mourinho and you're talking about a winner.

"Winning is United's, Jose's and my philosophy. We can make a great team and I welcome him.

"I've got three more years on my contract with United and the desire to win more titles here.

"When it comes to United, if you don't win everything, it's not good enough. This FA Cup is important for the club, it's important for the fans, and it's an important step towards winning major titles again."

1412~~~
I swear to feck I never heard the word ''philosophy'' mentioned in or around football until that idiot took charge.

1413~~~
Certainly looking like De Gea will end up staying. First with Mourinho coming in and all the noise being along the lines of "no chance will we let him go". Now Marca saying Madrid are ending their interest in De Gea after Zidane convinced Perez that Navas is his goalkeeper and he doesn't want Dave. Last summer after the window ended I thought it was the type of thing where De Gea is giving us one more season and he would leave this summer, but at this point I'm very confident that he's staying now for the foreseeable future. Especially with us (hopefully) back on the right track and can realistically start competing for trophies again.

1414~~~
Mourinho saves Dave! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1415~~~
Isn't Villa Valencian?  Catalan and Valecian culture have more in common than they do with Castilian/Leon culture.  I've seen separatist graffiti in Catalan all the way down to Alicante, south of Valencia--not to mention the dual-language road signs and language courses required in the schools.

1416~~~
De Gea now talking in radio

"United needed a coach like Mourinho, winner with personality and character, his signing is a success"

"I am very grateful with United and very happy there"

1417~~~
I know nothing about Madrid not wanting to sign me ; I am calm , I have three years at United, a club that has given me everything "

1418~~~
So he does know? The double negative has me confused.

1419~~~
Yes , sorry, that part is difficult to translate.They ask him if he already knows that Madrid does not want to sign him(the article in Marca) and he replies that he knows nothing about it ..that is calm, blabla

1420~~~
Ah its no problem, but I understand now.

1421~~~
Glad that De Gea's sounding like he wants to stay now. Last season his head was in the clouds and imo was rightfully benched. Didn't think he was as good as the last 2 seasons before this one though but still one of the few good players we have.

1422~~~

1423~~~
Potential captain here if he stays a few more years.

1424~~~
I imagine he'll be off to Madrid in a couple of years. Can't see him signing another new contract and Zidane will most likely be sacked by then.

1425~~~
Hang on, I just saw a headline about it is a close call between De Gea and Casillas for Spanish #1.

Please tell me that clown is not still in contention?

1426~~~
He is .

1427~~~
Looks like he is happy to work with Mourinho, good to know. 

Changing your story Damo? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1428~~~
I think it depends how the next few years under Mourinho pans out. If we are succesfull and also compete for the CL then who knows, because he does seem pretty settled in Manchester.

1429~~~
Jose pretty much sealed the deal. get in Jose!

1430~~~
I think he is going to stay here for the foreseeable future as we may well have priced Madrid out of a move for him by handing him a very lucrative deal (~£200k/week according to reports at the time). Before Dave signed his new contract he was on ~£80k/week, so it would have still made sense in terms of career progression to sign the ~£150k/week contract that Madrid had offered him (and reject United’s offer) as he was still getting a considerable raise from his old United contract and getting to go play in his hometown. With the new contract, he’d probably need to take a sizeable wage cut to sign for Madrid as don’t think Madrid will be willing to pay such a high salary to a goalkeeper (on top of the gigantic transfer fee that United will demand now that the release clause is set to expire).

1431~~~
If DDG does not start for Spain, then the coach should be fired

1432~~~
Isn't he gone after the euros?

1433~~~
I wouldnt be sure unless he retires. He always seems to be there, whether he plays well or not

1434~~~
Madrid acting like they were going to do him a favour by signing him.

1435~~~
That is what my feeling is as well. I hope we give him another offer by the end of this season and make sure he signs it.

1436~~~
Best news is if he stays this summer, we have him for 2 years minimum as Madrid will then very likely then enter a transfer ban.

1437~~~
He has three years left but the club have the option of extending it. It's practically four years. People already fearing we might lose him in three years. Ffs, can't you guys just be positive for once?

1438~~~
Say what you want about Jose's impending chaos, But he has done well so far to steady the ship.
<ol>
<li>Got a striker (seemingly) sorted</li>
<li>Sanctioned Carricks extension</li>
<li>Got a CB in</li>
<li>Got De Gea to commit nice and early = we don't have rumours all summer.</li>
</ol>I am pretty sure by mid July the team will be fully assembled and good to go. No one values great starts to a season better than Jose.

1439~~~
I like this. Whether his true feelings or not, it's nice to see a World class player say this kind of thing. 

I also believe what he says to be honest. Last summer he was very quiet and kept his council, very respectful to the club and fans by not getting involved in the drama and keeping his head down. This summer he has already affirmed his intentions to stay. Easily my favourite player at the club right now.

1440~~~
I meant del Bosque is gone after this summer. Maybe I'm mistaken.

1441~~~
No I'm sure he said this tournament is his last. Could change his mind though.

1442~~~
I'm actually surprised by DDG's average rating. It should actually be much higher (my own rating is even lower)

1443~~~

1444~~~

1445~~~
Can't see any of the tweets mate.

1446~~~
Accused of having Sex with an Underage girl. Looks like his career is over.

No he's not. Better to read the report rather than making accusations like that.

<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/serendipities" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/serendipities</a>

Here's a better summary of the case. Read it before making stupid statements like this.

1452~~~
fecking hell David. This looks like another Adam Johnson case.

1453~~~
People are being idiots here. No where it's written in the report that David sexually assaulted anyone let alone a underage girl. fecking dicks.

1454~~~
Calm the feck down.

1455~~~
Not good

1456~~~
So he isn't accused of having sex with an underage girl, but it's still looks pretty bad.

1457~~~
Isco is involved according to El Confidencial

Oh FFS, why do our palyers always have to be involved in some shite?

1463~~~
So he is implicated of arranging some sort of sex deal with this Torbe guy? Presumably for Muniain and the third, who is expected to be Isco?

1464~~~
How exactly do you contract a prostitute against her will? Like the sexual encounter could definitely have happened without consent, but how can you accept an offer to travel up to a party without consenting?

<a class="username" data-user="90429, @VanGaalEra" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90429/">@VanGaalEra</a> this is the second time in 2 days you've posted a tweet by a fake account. Stop it. Anyone with "reporter for ForestEchoNews" in their bio is bullshit.

1467~~~
Is he really out of the Spain squad ?

1468~~~
No.

1469~~~
From what I gathered, he arranged a meeting between this witness and two other players (believed to be Munian and Isco, though Javi Martinez name is also in there) and they sexually assaulted her.

De Gea was not actually there.

1470~~~
I deleted that other one within like 10 seconds. Apologies for this one.

1471~~~
Quick, sell him to Madrid

1472~~~
What the hell is going on?

1473~~~
now we know why they are no longer interested.

1474~~~
Is he in serious trouble ? Or is this similar to the "Ander match fixing thing "?

1475~~~
He's innocent.

1476~~~
I genuinely have no idea tbh. 

If he wasn't involved in the actual assault, surely can't be that serious? Though that Rafael guy on twitter says arranging the meet is also a crime. Don't see why that's a crime unless he knew what they were planning.

1477~~~
Doubt he's in serious trouble.

1478~~~
He's probably talking BS.

1479~~~
Should have foreseen this after the doughnut incident.

1480~~~
Let's try to keep this discussion in the appropriate thread. No need to taint this thread in case it turns out to be false.

Edit: Agreed MODs?

1481~~~
This should be moved to a new thread.

1482~~~
If it can be proven that he arranged the meeting knowing what the other players planned to do, then yeah I'm sure he would be in deep deep trouble. Best find a great lawyer David.

1483~~~
Maybe Edurne will bin him off now, and he'll shack up with some strumpet from Wythenshawe and stay here forever...

1484~~~
He is in a good mess and the evidences seem very clear.I wonder how many players can be involved.

1485~~~
Is it being given proper coverage in Spain?

1486~~~
We knew about Torbe and the investigation some weeks ago but all this is new

1487~~~
Dave will save himself. 
<span style="color: #ffffff">Saving is his thing</span>

1488~~~
Apparently sent home and not going to be involved in the Euros...

Woody ordering a new fax machine for Madrid as I type..

He's getting all the heat, but he hardly seems a central figure.

1490~~~
It is just him and Munian so far, they will obviosuly jump on him being a United player.

1491~~~
I'm hoping the last par of that piece is good news.

1492~~~
All not true.

1493~~~
How did he play today? I didn't catch the game.

1494~~~
Had very little to do.

1495~~~
Made a good save near the end, but didn't have much to do the rest of the game.

1496~~~
Did what you want from him, nothing for the whole game, but kept his concentration at the one or two shots at him (esp the one near the end). You expect him to save it though which he did.

1497~~~
Cool.

1498~~~
Seen better from him, he'll be disappointed he couldn't catch it.

1500~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> De Gea has comfortably been the better keeper for around 3 seasons now.

1501~~~
del Bosque is a weirdo.

1502~~~
Marginal or not, at least Del Bosque accepted he is the better keeper. Should have done it 2 years back though.

1503~~~
Congrats to adage on becoming Spain number 1.  It's been a pleasure to see him grow from a widely derided keeper in the media to the world's best. 
"Marginally better" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1504~~~
If De Gea keeps a clean sheet today he breaks Banks record of competitive clean sheets following his debut right? Without jinxing anything <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/> I wonder how long he could extend it and make it his own. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1505~~~
Its funny that a lot of rival fans said that what he was missing to be rated as high as Neuer was success in the big tournaments... things like the euros. The way its going, he can go far with hardly having to do anything other then take a few goal kicks. Guess whatever works though

1506~~~
Probably bored out of his mind here and realizing he'd hate playing for good teams like Real or Barca.

1507~~~
We'll finally see how much Casillas' international record was depending on the team. Anyway he was outstanding in play-offs from 08 to 12 though.

1508~~~
I'm glad he'll be well rested for the new season.

1509~~~

1510~~~
Guessing they're on about competitive games? He conceded against Georgia three games ago.

1511~~~
Yes, it's for competitive matches.

1512~~~
It's great news for us that he's Spain's Number 1 goalkeeper. I'm sure the fear of being overlooked while he didn't play in La Liga was a factor for him.

1513~~~
It's got it's good and bad points I suppose. It'll make him more "mainstream" in Spain, and might actually mean he becomes popular in those silly Marca polls they do. Good job they've said they are happy with Navas for now anyway <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

He gets a lot of grief on Twitter from Cassillas fans. 
The cult around Iker is incredible. 
Every post on Twitter and you see some abusing him.

1519~~~
spot on <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1520~~~
How dare they criticise De Gea!!

1521~~~
Garbage performance. Cost Spain.

1522~~~
Poor bloke. One bad game in 3 years and he will probably get slated and dropped. Doesn't help that Ramos was dreadful.

1523~~~
Hope you're watching this Madrid and Barca!!!  Overrated!!!

1524~~~
So did Ramos. Defensively they have collectively been sloppy and asking to be punished.

1525~~~
There's a clear agenda against De Gea when it comes to him and the English media

1526~~~
Very unlike De Gea to have such a poor game. He makes much more difficult saves than the one he had to make for that 2nd goal.

1527~~~
The first goal was in no way his fault. 

The second looked poor in real time but took a deflection to go past him.

1528~~~
Hopefully that game puts other teams off him for a year or so

1529~~~
Not great today.

1530~~~
Hm?

1531~~~
This, don't make a stupid mistake which will cost you!

1532~~~
Vultures always circling with the English press with David. Not sure could have covered that much more of his near post anyway, plus it look a slight deflection....

1533~~~
Probably the worst player on the pitch today <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
Saved by the post after a horrendous mistake early in the game and conceded a goal he should've saved (even though there was a little deflection).

He is probably very nervous and you can see how he struggles to communicate with Ramos and Pique - but these things take time.

1534~~~
Angles were all wrong on that 2nd goal.

1535~~~
Good old Dave......

knew Spain had qualified so put in that performance to scare off Madrid...

Dave Saves and Dave Stays

1536~~~
I'd have been very very surprised if you're not on here!

1537~~~
Our players always seem to be crap in tournos. Park was always the best in World Cups.

1538~~~
If he did still have ambition to join Madrid, he's not won the fans over after that performance

1539~~~
He is never on Neuers level and the Caf remains to always overrate our players. Worst player today and should deservedly be dropped for Casillas. 

<span style="color: #ffffff">(How most people on here think after a bad performance)</span>

1540~~~
Poor Dave. Looked very anxious tonight. I guess it's a case of finally getting the No.1 spot for Spain and not wanting to make any mistakes - and of course that's exactly what he ends up doing.

1541~~~
I don't understand, they hammered him when he first got here, fair enough, but they've consistently praised him as the best in the premier league every appearance for the last couple years.

1542~~~
Not even on the level of Keylor Navas, Zidane is absolutely right to drop all interest in him and persist with Navas.

1543~~~
Mind is in Manchester.

1544~~~
Poor performance from him, not the De Gea we're used to at United. Perhaps he doesn't feel comfortable with the idea that he still has to prove himself for Spain. Whatever the reason, not a good game. Still wouldn't trade him for anyone at United though, we know just how good he is.

1545~~~
He wasn't in the right position for the 2nd goal but still would've saved it if it didn't take that small deflection. 
He didn't expect the shit and that's the issue.

1546~~~
He's still the best keeper in the world, everyone is allowed an off day ffs.

1547~~~
Might be me but Utd players are always under the spotlight in a very different way than others by the English press.....

1548~~~
Yeah he's utter crap! Real, stay well clear of this fraud. Thanks.

1549~~~
With the second goal, far from being a mistake, I think it's impressive he got as close to it as he did. The deflection was big because it was immediately after the shot was struck, it was literally the difference between the ball going in one corner or the other. And he went the right way to begin with. Really can't see any fault with him there. His overall performance though didn't seem as assured as we'd expect.

1550~~~
He's always been crap, hasn't he? Never rated him. At best he should be playing for the likes of Bournemouth, Watford etc. 
<span style="color: #ffffff">Feck off Perez</span>

1551~~~
Overrate.....I'm going to bed rather than reading this crap.

1552~~~
One would assume that the concentration lapses are down to the Torbe stuff. But he did look fine the two matches before... Maybe it was just a blip.

1553~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1554~~~
I think the Torbe case has been weighing on his mind. I mean it is not a small accusation facilitating hookers for his teammates.
Would not be surprised if he is dropped for the next game against most propably Italy. He did have a howler of a game tonight.

1555~~~
White text not enough for you? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1556~~~
It always irritates me how everyone will jump on a 'keeper for making a single mistake. Outfield players make mistakes all the time, but apparently a 'keeper doing it is unforgivable. It's perfectly okay for even the very best to make mistakes now and then. What makes De Gea one of the best is that the mistakes are few and far between and overall he's bloody brilliant.

1557~~~
snap Madrid's hand off!!!

1558~~~
He cheated to his left assuming the shot or cross would go that way, got wrong-footed by the deflection. Mistake. Also got lucky Rakitic's shot on his mistake didn't go in. So turns out he's human after all. Add him to the long list of top players having a poor tournament.

1559~~~
No excuses, he simply didn't do well today. It happens, but it's always costly in such a tournament with a legend sitting behind you, waiting to replace you.

1560~~~
Yeah have to admit I felt the same. Feel a bit of a twat for thinking it though, given how gutted he must be.

Hard to see RM coming back for him now. Imagine he'll be hounded in the Spanish press mercilessly.

1561~~~
Sell.

1562~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1563~~~
Worst game in decades. Looked awful. Maybe that sex thing affects him. Even his decent save from close-range was basically his attempt to correct his own mistake.

1564~~~
Worst performance of his since that City game in 2011 community shield. Should keep madrid away thankfully

1565~~~
Just saw the BBC Report on Spain's game - sounds like he was absolutely terrible tonight.

1566~~~
I think it's clear that his good form was completely down to LVG.

1567~~~
I mean he wasn't good. Probably the worst performance I've seen from him since his first year here. Shows he human though...

1568~~~

1571~~~
He did that so Madrid will back off. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Seriously though, mistake for Rakitić's lob, one bad boxing of the ball and tbh he should have saved Perišić's goal. It's keeper's angle every time, no matter the deflection.

1572~~~
And Moyesy, before that.

1573~~~
so has he left his girlfriend in Madrid?

1574~~~
This is the worst I can remember David de Gea playing (and I remember Bournemouth away last season! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>)

There was just an overwhelming complacency about Spain from the seventh minute of tonight's game. De Gea's performance typified it. Despite picking their first choice players, Spain played as though all they had to do was turn up to win. They clearly did not expect the Croats to have a go and De Gea was caught off guard, like his teammates, several times. The concentration that you usually see from him just wasn't there. Lots of very small but noticeable little errors. Its as if he thought, Spain being Spain, he wouldn't have much to do and so he could relax. The silver lining is that Real Madrid won't be in a rush to sign him after tonight. The Spanish public will slaughter him mercilessly for that second goal...

1575~~~
Should knock a nice £10m off his price for Real.

1576~~~
If I was Madrid, I wouldn't even look twice at him. I really don't know how we're gonna survive with this guy in our goals next season. Can the man do anything right?

1577~~~
I think she left him after final whistle tonight

1578~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> Suddenly DDG made Euro much more interesting with coming the knockout round <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1579~~~
He was poor tonight and he made a few mistakes but it's probably his first bad game I can think of since Sunderland away In the season just gone which was months ago. He does let the occasional soft goal in though I've noticed this season. It's usually because he's always so hell bent on using his legs even if it's going in the top corner. 
Seriously though, he's a top keeper and if he doesn't get shunned forever he'll soon make the no1 spot his own for Spain

1580~~~
He had a poor game. Strange.

1581~~~
Couple more performances like these and we could happily extend his contract on the final year without any hassles <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1582~~~
I hope Spain never win another game if De Gea is dropped.

1583~~~
This shoud keep Madrid off him for a couple of seasons more at least <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1584~~~
All top keepers have an off night. He'll need a few more like that before Spain would drop him.

1585~~~
His errors weren't uncharacteristic. He's a good and spectaculair goalkeeper, but not without his flaws, it's nothing that we haven't seen before. It's certainly not the first time he doesn't cover the near post.

1586~~~
I think mistakes that cost goals/near misses from DDG are quite rare, so they they tend to get highlighted when they happen. Spain got away with one when he had the ball taken off him and Rakitic hit the bar, how much the deflection played a part in the winner I am not sure.

1587~~~
He has a bad game twice a year or so. Yet people like to go crazy about it but that actually speaks for him

1588~~~
He's not one to show much emotion facially, but I thought he had the vibe of someone not really there mentally - like going through the motions.

1589~~~
Lol....only just read it!!!

1590~~~
Is it just me or are half the shots that beat him deflections? He needs to work on some sorts of ricochet drills to further improve his reflexes.

1591~~~
The second goal seemed similar to the deflected goal Daniel Sturridge scored against us at Anfield when we won 2-1 in 2014/15.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pTqDtVZ9jw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Still think De Gea should be better positioned for the Croatia second goal, but without the deflection, he saves it easily I think.

1592~~~
"Is it just me or are half the shots that beat him deflections?"

This is something I have noticed too. I watch only him most of the time, so my query is : does this happen with other goalkeepers as well?

1593~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Absurd.

Reaction is one of his biggest strengths, which allows him to wait longer before committing, which has saved us time and time again.

No wait, sell the spanish twat and bring in Foster.

1594~~~
Haha yep the keeper with the quickest reaction times in the world, who regularly makes some of the sharpest saves I've ever seen need to improve his reactions <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. There's either some idiots on here or its becoming a parody site, not all keepers can save everything and mistakes are part and parcel of football, get over it.

1595~~~
Not the same without blind and Smalling in front it seems

1596~~~
The only idiocy here is suggesting that just because he has incredible reflexes there isn't any room for improvement at all.

1597~~~
He has some of the best reactions in the world and honestly compared to pretty much all keepers his reactions are out of this world. Your just highlighting afew soft goals, newsflash keeps don't stop everything and do make mistakes. He really can't improve much on the reaction part of his game, positioning though, that could perhaps be worked on.

1598~~~
It's probably because of his reflexes that he tends to leave a gap a the near post. But that has gone wrong a bit too often, with or without a deflection.

1599~~~
Just watched the game. Worst I've seen him play in a long time. I hope he doesn't get dropped (he doesn't deserve to considering how long Iker got despite being awful). Not really that fussed though. One bad game every 100 or so is more than acceptable.

1600~~~
Honestly couldn't care about that performance. Wouldn't mind him being sloppy for the rest of the tournament. Would put off the vultures from a potential transfer.

1601~~~
All 3 of those examples above are deflected and from very close range. Near post or not, anyone who has ever played in goal will tell you that a deflection totally destroys your preparation for a shot. You look at the way the body opens up to shoot, you track the ball, and when it has even the slightest change in direction, it's very difficult to recover, often impossible. It can completely change the direction on the ball, or it can add a spin and swerve that wouldn't have been possible for the striker to put on the ball.

Nothing wrong with his positioning on any of those. The deflection bends the ball around him on all 3. If he was any closer to the near post, it exposes the far side of him. Strikers are coached to go across the goalkeeper, near posts shots happen, but they're not as common. If all 3 of those shots were struck without the following deflection, DDG saves all of them, IMO.

1602~~~
I don't think anyone on here would consider De Gea to be the worst player out there today. That would comfortably be Sergio Ramos who had occasional lapses in concentration(which is quite usual for him) , didn't mark his man for Croatia's first goal and missed a penalty.

I just feel lucky that we have a goal keeper who is being slated for missing a shot that was deflected into his near post and this being comfortably his worst performance in last 2 years. We are a bit spoiled.

1603~~~
Yeah pretty much this. His ability and confidence in his reactions and positionings means he leaves gaps. You take the 100 saves that he makes because of his reading of the game and giveth the deflections or freak shots that creep in you'd expect a well positioned 'normal' keeper to save.

1604~~~
Having an absolute mare at this tournament wtf has happened to him?

1605~~~
He's made two stunning stops this game and the goal while not great keeping is hardly a huge error .

1606~~~
Always been rubbish.

1607~~~
I've only just got in so only seen the goal but it was an error that the so called best keeper in the world shouldn't be making 

They'll be no debate after this who's the best keeper in the world

1608~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/qc0o" width="560"></iframe>

1609~~~
It was an error for sure. He looks like a completely different player for Spain.

1610~~~
Having a great game.

1611~~~
What game you watching?

1612~~~
Its like DDG never left united in the euro's, his team having plenty of possesion but hes been the busy of the 2 keepers

1613~~~
So are you saying that the best keeper in the world should never make mistakes? He's also made 3 fantastic saves that most keepers in this competition wouldn't have saved. He could do better for the goal sure, but it's hardly an error, why are people not focussing on the fact that there are no Spanish players anywhere near the goal while Italy had 3-4. 
Anyway I hope people think he's shite so that we can keep him forever, best in the world for me

1614~~~
Is anyone watching what minute is it? I thought it was a pretty early kick off.

1615~~~
Brilliant 'keeper and it's a shame that the knee-jerk generation are so eager to jump on every mistake he makes (which is hardly any at all) and put him down.

1616~~~
Giacherrini chance - nice save by DDG

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/bs7j" width="560"></iframe>

1617~~~
Weird. Neuer's unquestionably more mistake-prone than De Gea. I think he's the better keeper but mistakes are not in his favour.

1618~~~
Not on tv unfortunately.

1619~~~
Tell me who you think the best is and I'll show you a recent error from them.

Poor DDG is getting peppered here <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1620~~~
him having a poor Euro is a good thing from United perspective, hopefully Real will feck off after this.

1621~~~
He is keeping Spain in this match..  Some people..

1622~~~
Had good saves but at fault for the goal imo

1623~~~
Honestly? I could've sworn they were all going to be on telly.

1624~~~
I agree but the difference is Neuer gets away with 99.9% of his errors amazingly

1625~~~
I agree but I also think DDG is better than Neuer!

1626~~~
This is a good thing

1627~~~
Some really good saves and one bad mistake. Form has not been as strong. However, Ramos should get equally the amount of criticism for the bonehead FK he gave away in the first place.

1628~~~
Eh?

1629~~~
He didn't even try to catch it. He tried to push it away and just got it spectacularly wrong.

It's fair enough, it happens. Doesn't mean people aren't allowed to point it out as bad keeping. We wank him off enough in this thread.

1630~~~
Should have stuck with Casillas.

1631~~~
He made a few great saves but has to take some blame for the goal.

1632~~~
With Neuer in goal the way Spain has been "defending" they would be down 2-0.

That is all. The usual opponent fans and twats watching the BL as normal can't wait to get on De Gea's back though.

1633~~~
This again. He has already rejected them.

1634~~~
Harsh to blame him imo. He was wrong to parry it but if one more defender runs in, it could have been cleared.

It was slightly deflected. Also, it's not his fault that the Spanish defence was sleeping. It's a collective failure and not an individual goalkeeping error.

However, his confidence looks shot while playing for Spain. He looks like a completely different player, unsure of himself.

1636~~~
IMO at fault for the goal. Two great saves hardly make it up.

1637~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It would have been 2-0 or 3-0 by now with Ramos ahead of him.

1638~~~
It's honestly the oddest thing how defensive people get about de Gea. He's had a shocker for 2 goals this tournament really and people will rightfully criticise him. He's not been awful but I'd hardly say he's been great. The 2 mistakes were pretty simple saves and he should be criticised. It's funny how people use the "quick to get on the back" shite but if Neuer or Hart made them mistakes they'd be laughed at for ages..people in glass houses and all that.

1639~~~
I can understand saying he shocked push it to the side, but anyone saying he should catch it are actually idiots candy are getting sucked in by a slow motion replay. The surface is wet, it's 20 yards out and he literally smashed it at ground level, impossible to catch that but could possibly have been pushed wider.

1641~~~
But it's when people like you say 'shocker' that I get defensive, bales free kick with hart is a howler, de geas two errors are just that, mistakes but they are in now way howlers. I guess that's credit to De Gea that his standards are that high then any small mistake is jumped upon as if it's huge.

1642~~~
The Spanish defence were to blame for that Italian goal. They weren't even set up. Piqué was literally not looking at the free kick taker when he took it. Sure, De Gea made a tiny error by not palming it away, but they were asleep. Otherwise, he's kept them in it, with some excellent saves from Pelle and Giaccherini.

1643~~~
are you 100% sure about that? im not tbh, not after that last day fiasco, pretty sure nobody outside 2 clubs knows what the feck happened there.
And even if you are right and i hope you are, it means little as situations in football change quickly.

1644~~~
Nothing, exactly the same keeper as last season: Spectacular saves, little mistakes and the odd big one.

1645~~~
Seriously? Can you give us a breakdown of the difference between "mistake" "howler" "error" etc? It's just made up things to make out de Gea is never at fault. I don't get the harm in people saying he fecked up or isn't having the best tournament (a keeper making 2 mistakes in 4 games isn't exactly a great tournament people are making out.) I've not seen anyone say he's shit or anything like that just he should of done better for a goal and they don't think he's playing great. Is that really that much of a terrible comment?

Footballers make mistakes and that's all people said. It's no different to Hart making a mistake vs. Wales but for some reaosn people get really defensive about it....well I say some reason it's probably cos most of us are United fans and he's the current golden child who can do no wrong apparently. People exonerating him of all blame are far more over the top than those saying he isn't having a good game.

1646~~~
If I have to explain that there's different levels of mistakes then I'm speaking to the wrong person...

1647~~~
Looking more foolish by the second this.

1648~~~
I still think he looks very nervous for Spain. When playing for us, he seems so calm - as if it's his team.

Regarding the goal, I consider it a mistake. Overall in this game, he has saved enough to be absolved. Regardless, Spain aren't good enough this game.

1649~~~
So good on 1 v 1's. Always a brief moment of 'oh shit' when they break through until I remember De Gea is back there

1650~~~
Italy should have been 3 or 4 up. De Gea keeping Spain in it.

1651~~~
You wouldn't swap him for anyone would you. He's brilliant.

1652~~~
Brilliant keeper, how rubbish are Pique and Ramos at times though? My God <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1653~~~
He's saved their asses thrice (header, Giacherrini, 1v1) but the goal is partially his fault too.

1654~~~
Which translates to "I was speaking absolute shite and both are mistakes"

Again, people suggesting you wouldn't swap him etc...no one said we would!!! Just he made a mistake. no one has answered why everyone gets so defensive about it yet?

I'm not even doubting he's made a few good saves but he made a big mistake as well. 

You can tell people are scraping the barrel when they're find old Neuer mistakes as well. It's Liverpool esque this defensiveness of de Gea, it happens any time he makes a mistake it's honestly a bit cringing.

1655~~~
I think they are just bored of winning top trophies now

1656~~~
What the feck...<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>...apples and samsungs

1657~~~
Must be, we all know how good they are but they really have some awful performances.

1658~~~
The goal was definitely his fault

And he made that other error a few mins ago that very led to another

But he has made some good stops (one great)

Mixed bag

1659~~~
If you want to be technical, the fault is on Ramos for brainlessly lunging in on Giaccherini who was going absolutely nowhere.

1660~~~
Spain's best player by a distance.

Two world class saves on the line, one save 1x1 and he actually saved the free kick. In a best case scenario he should have tipped the ball to the right but it wasn't by any means a bad save. How about some help from his defenders to start with?

But...maybe some of you prefer Mignolet

1661~~~
He must be the most scrutinised keeper in Europe. His misfortune to be stuck in an era playing for two teams that were once great. Honestly , some of you expect him to save damn near everything. At the end of the day he's not God.

1662~~~
He plays at such a high level that any error no matter how small is analyzed to deat because of its rarity. 
If another keeper was in goal, Spain would be looking at a demolition.

1663~~~
If any player is immune to criticism its De Gea because he rarely makes mistakes

1664~~~

1665~~~
Could have done better for the first goal today, and the one in the group stage. Fluffed a few crosses as well. 

Still save Spain's blushes. You Gotta take the pros and the cons when we talk about our own. No need for people to get so defensive. Dave played below the high bar he set himself - learn from it and he'll grow stronger. Simples.

1666~~~
Was one of (if not) the best player on the pitch. If it wasn't for him, Spain would surely have been humiliated taday. Unfortunately will get criticized heavily for that one mistake which he definitely should have done better though.

1667~~~
Of course you can "grade" mistakes. De Gea's today was a fairly minor one, akin to a bad touch. He spilled the ball, it lead to a goal. He should have done better, but just like with bad touches, it happens.

Hart's was a howler of massive proportions. He was dumb enough to set up a wall to defend a free-kick at 40 yards, effectively blocking his view of the ball and making his own job much harder. Extremely poor decision making, and way worse than spilling the ball trying to save a shot at goal.

That said, De Gea made a mistake and it lead to a goal. Criticizing him for making that mistake is fair.

1668~~~
What did this say?

1669~~~
Can't blame him, today Spanish defense was even shittier than the one in United.

Perhaps he should go out and score goals, too ?

1670~~~

1671~~~
Seems to be deleted?

1672~~~
DDG's biggest mistake was that he was supposed to be start the tiki taka passing from the back. Instead he constantly kicked the ball long leading to be verbally chastised by Iniesta in the first half. This was one of the reasons why Spain could not get their passing game going.

As for the goal, the way the wall was placed to cover half the goal is a new tactic being used by defensive and goalkeeping coaches to ensure that GKs have their line of sight clear and to minimise deflected goals. However when you give the free kick taker half a goal to aim at chances of him hitting the target are a100% and if he swerves the ball within the 6 yard box inward towards  then the goalkeeper then the goalkeeper makes a save with the body and the ball ricochets into the middle of the penalty box. A more conventional placement of the wall would have stopped the goal. DDG made the save with his forearms and not with his fist which would have enabled him to push the ball towards the sidelines.

1673~~~
I wil take David De Gea over Joe Hart any day.

1674~~~
Who wouldn't?!?

1675~~~
That was part of Conte's plan. Prevent De Gea from starting to build the Spanish attack from the back and force him to hit long balls where the Italians had the aerial advantage.

1676~~~
It's unbelievable that there was even a debate over who was better. De Gea was better from day one.

1677~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1678~~~
But Ramos, Pique and especially Alaba were open for passes many times. But DDG kept ignoring them and they kept ignoring him.

1679~~~
Yes, but when De Gea played to ball to them, the Italians would pressure the Spanish defenders to pass back toward goal resulting in the long ball.

1680~~~
Manchester United fans defend a Manchester United player. They don't defend a Manchester City player, nor a Bayern Munich one. Not that odd to me.

1681~~~
Casillas wasn't great with the ball at his feet so I don't know how DDG is such a big comedown from that.

1682~~~
I said it's a mistake is a mistake, not ranking which 1 is bad or worse or whatever. A mistake that costs a goal is am istake it's the problem being a keeper, Hart had a shocker for the goal today but so did de Gea, it was a simple shot and he fecked it up, seriously people need to get over it.

My point was more stuff like "howler" is just a generic comment. I don't get how de Gea's is a "minor" mistake, the reality is it cost his team a goal, surely that's a big mistake. Can you explain how it's not? Gerrard slipping over for example could be seen as a minor mistake as well surely? Danny Rose fell over about 3 times today but nothing came of it. So what makes Gerrard's a masive mistake and Danny Rose's feck all? The fact one cost his team a league and the other meant nothing. My point being surely a mistake that costs a team a goal is a big mistake.

Not my point really, I don't expect people to be praising Hart for example I just find it odd that people get so defensive when people rightfully say a keeper made a mistake.

1683~~~
Hardly he was at fault for the winning goal. He's had an awful tournament there's no denying it otherwise

1684~~~
TBH, as great a keeper he no doubt is, I felt he should have done better with Italy's first goal. No qualms with the result though, Italy were absolute class and having watched enviously at Serie A during the 90's I still harbour a massive respect for the way they play their football.

1685~~~
Ffs we shoulda sold him when we had the chance. 

<span style="color: #ffffff">lol</span>

1686~~~
He's had an unusual amount of errors during the tournament, but also some world class saves. In order to be the best in the world, he needs to become more consistent with Spain as well. It was his first big tournament as the starter, nerves most likely played a role no matter what.
With that being said, I also thought the defending on Ramos and Pique was unusually poor. They're both prone to a blender or two, no doubt about it, but they were caught out of position too many times in my opinion. Add to it that Spain just lacked dangerous players in the final third and you'll have your reason for their early exit. Not to mention that Italy is playing decent football as well.

1687~~~
Surely he follows instructions.

Don't know about the Spanish press but he was MoTM for Spain today by a country mile for various sports websites in France, and if not for him they would have been humiliated. The only things he lacks are communication and leadership skills a la Van der Sar, otherwise we all know he's at least in the top 3 goalies in the world.

1688~~~
this is what happens when the manager waits until the eve of a major tournament to finally hand the job over to him instead of at the beginning of qualifying.

1689~~~
I agreed with the poster you quoted. So it's not just communication, commanding/leadership. It's also the limitation in DDG distribution, which many people didn't understand when hearing LVG and his goalkeeping coaching staff criticized DDG's distribution occasionally, even though DDG provided savior's GK performance!

With United, LVG had to compromise and let DDG used more long ball, hence the regular inclusion of someone like Fellaini in midfield, due to several factors: DDG's distribution is not at the required level yet, Smalling's terrible on ball ability, PL tactical indisciplined nature that can be exploited with long ball,... However, with Spain, they don't have a tower upfield to compete for long ball so they depend on passing out from the back all time. This passing out from the back is vital for their play as it help them to regain composure in games where they were pressed out of game upfield. They have ball playing CBs, FBs, midfielders, so no excuse of not able to passing out from the back. DDG's distribution is not up there yet and Italy noticed and played a perfect tactic and successfully disrupted Spain passing game rhythm.

DDG's distribution is not bad for the level, style of PL teams. He is arguably among the very best. It just happens that the level demanded by Spain NT is much higher and DDG is not there. Perhaps, this EURO is a blessing in disguise for us. Real Madrid may find themselves happy with Navas and never comes back for DDG this way. LVG and his staffs really rated Navas who has better distribution that fits their style better.

If DDG improves his distribution further quickly, then it's a bonus. However, it's not a pressing priority for him here with us. With Mourinho, he would be more protected, so he first needs to adapt to Mourinno style first, then improve his commanding skill. Then keep pressing on improving dominating in the box and get more comfortable in the air.

1690~~~
Some of the stuff I've read on here is an absolute joke. Sometimes you need players around you to finish what couldn't fully complete. He couldn't turn the free kick round the post, was too close to his body and hit too hard to catch. Where was the Spanish defenders to react? The shot going to the top corner was just outstanding....

1691~~~
Exactly the thing I said to one of my friends who was blaming DDG solely for the goal

1692~~~
And now DDG's distribution is being questioned? What the actual feck!!

1693~~~
I'm sorry but De Gea is one of the best ball playing goal keepers I've seen and his distribution is amazing. Simply put the Italian system yesterday had 2 strikers up top which allowed them to press the Spanish defence thus preventing quick passes back to the defence. That was a deliberate tactical move from conte and it was fairly obvious that it worked. De Gea had many occasions where he had no choice but to pump the ball long in search of morata an while his passing was pin point morata got bullied all day by the Italians. He is better on the ball than navas tho but I hope Madrid think like you.

1694~~~
His distribution isn't bad at all and it's not like Casillas was the Xavi of keepers or something.

1695~~~

1696~~~
<a class="username" data-user="95327, @TrustInJanuzai" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/95327/">@TrustInJanuzai</a> There were times in the yesterday game, DDG ignored short pass options. Not saying DDG boots long ball unreasonably every time. Could have done better. The vs argument is pretty much matter of opinion though.

<a class="username" data-user="95869, @prath92" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/95869/">@prath92</a> No one says DDG distribution is "bad". Spain midfield was stronger with Xavi, Alonso and Iniesta at their peak along with Busquet, so they were better pushing team back. Casillas did well in that circumstances before declining and be a joke. Casillas command and communicate better/ more vocal that helped him in asking for help from his teammate LOL.

Honestly, why the need to bring up comparison with Casillas? It's not like I was asking for Casillas to be in goal? I was constructively discussing about this game, this current Spain where, if DDG can up his distribution to Bravo's level (IMO the top ball playing keeper at the moment), DDG can help to change the game! I am not saying other Spain outfield players were flawless neither. I could care less about those. Here I am caring about our player and see things he can improve. This is not blaming. Did I ever mention the goals? (See the whole point in my last post)<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1697~~~
I blame Del Bosque.

He just couldn't make up his mind about who's no 1 for Spain when it's been perfectly clear for everybody else for 3 years that De Gea is Spain's best GK.
No wonder De Gea might feel nervous during games about losing his place when in reality him and Iniesta should be the first names on the team sheet.

At United he knows he's God and plays accordingly.

Shouldn't VDB resign now after stinking up two tournaments? 68 is he?

1698~~~
Agree. Chemistry and understanding needs time. Del Bosque was too conservative and it hindered Spain and DDG's international career. He needs to be gone so Spain can get new ideas.

(Continued with DDG distribution idea) As they will have DDG from now on and can't suddenly expect his distribution and understanding with his teammates drastically improve overnight, they will need to figure out a different game plan in case other teams deploy the similar tactic to Italy's, to disrupt passing game being played out from the back. Get more physical upfield to compete for long ball, or different midfield parts in hope to bring back the level of peak Xavi, Alonso Iniesta Busquet, or....?

Del Bosque is out of magic as teams have caught up with his tactics.

1699~~~
While the consequences are the same, the nature of the mistakes say a lot. De Gea got to the ball, but it took a bad deflection back towards the middle of the box. I agree that it's a mistake, but it's a fairly minor one. A bad touch, or a miscalculation. It's something that's likely to happen to the best on occasion.

Hart's mistake was a conscious decision. He set up a wall to defend a free-kick from close to 40 yards, hindering his view and putting himself at a massive disadvantage. Then he stood around, looking at his creation, and was apparently fine with its existence. That takes some doing. Most GKs will tell you that you don't set up a wall at those distances, because you're better off just standing in the middle of the goal with clear view of the ball. It was a schoolboy level mistake from Hart, and not one top keepers should be making. Then again, Hart isn't a top keeper.

And you can't just go, "well, this guy slipped, guess that makes him as bad as Gerrard." Gerrard's mistake wasn't the slip itself, but the fact that he let the ball across him the way he did, as the last man, when Demba Ba was standing a just a few yards away. The slip came as a result of that mistake. Even if he hadn't slipped, there's still a good chance Ba would have gotten to the ball first.

AS gave him top ratings:

1708~~~
Adam Crafton, who is quite close to Dave's folks says De gea now sees his long term future here and hopes to be club captain.
What a remarkable turnaround from a player that was just minutes away from leaving.

1709~~~
I'd consider him as captain once Rooney isn't it anymore.

1710~~~
Which should be around September or October, when he's dropped for being a shit cnut

I would prefer the captain is not a goalkeeper.
