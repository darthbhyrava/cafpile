Good to have him back.

This guy and his passport issues <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8~~~
He's getting disciplined by LVG because of passport issues he has no control of? Am I missing something <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

9~~~
It's probably bullshit. They love to paint LvG as the unreasonable dictator.

10~~~
On the contrary, he is a very social human being.

11~~~

12~~~
That's bullshit <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

13~~~
Doesn't seem like the brightest guy to be fair <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

14~~~
Apparently his passport expired. Actually I'd agree that it's in his interest to have it extended, if he hadn't done that and misses two weeks of preseason because of that then it's only reasonable to not pay him for this period because he's cleary not working. If I virtually extended my holiday because I failed to fill in papers that'd allow me to work I'd not expect to receive money for those two weeks.

15~~~
We should fine Di Maria £59.7M

16~~~
Love this suggestion! 
At least let's send PSG the bill for any pay due to him starting from when he didn't show up<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

17~~~
I vote in favour of this!

18~~~
We need to stop signing Argentinians, forgetting to renew his passport...what an idiot

19~~~
If he's getting disciplined because of passport issues then it was 100% something that he was in control of - like forgetting to renew etc. LvG is strict, but he is not unreasonable.

20~~~
Has he reached the US? His tweet says almost back to training and has the MUTour hashtag. Is he training with the rest of the 1st team squad in the US?

21~~~
If you don't show to your work and have 3/4 days late, I guess that your boss will fire you.

I hope that he'll play in reserve the first few games in order to show him the respect of the club

22~~~
Fine him all right but playing him in the reserves would be OTT.

23~~~
Laurent Blanc fined and didn't played Lavezzi and Cavani last January because they were late.

I think that this would be good to play him with the reserve the first few games (match fitness :d)

24~~~
Amything in the Barca rumours then? Or did he genuinely forget to renew his passport?

25~~~
That turned out to be a fake agent. <a class="externalLink" href="http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/topics/star-s-agents-tells-us-the-truth-on-man-united-barca-transfer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/...lls-us-the-truth-on-man-united-barca-transfer</a>

The same fake agent has done it before regarding Rojo. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

26~~~
We've sent a few reserve players down to Argentina for a kick about with him to keep him fit. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

27~~~
We need to assign someone to make sure he keeps these issues cleaned up

28~~~
If it's really only that kind of issue there's no bigger problem, he'll join the group in Manchester and train for the next two weeks and hopefully he'll have few minutes in the season opener.

29~~~
Tbh, I'm amazed any footballers are trusted to sort stuff like passports themselves. Totally thought they'd have somebody to look after this sort of thing for them.

30~~~

31~~~
What a lad!

32~~~
The passport feck up isn't a great indicator this Argie will end up a good signing either. Maybe an innocent hiccup but not a great sign none the less.

So I guess his pal Di maria leaving could go two ways for his United career;

a) He's becomes unsettled without his friend, agitates to leave before long.

or b) He integrates more into the group/club culture, without any bad influences or distractions and starts performing well enough to nail down a place at CH.

He could well become our first choice CH as he has more natural ability than any of the others. 

Which begs the question; is he focused and determined enough to achieve it or will big Lou run out of patience and get shot of him?

33~~~
this is a guy who pisses off the former employer (not a good thing to do admittedly, but shows his eagerness) to play here. hopefully things go on positively

34~~~
Quite optimistic for Rojo's season - as <a class="username" data-user="93689, @darioterios" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/93689/">@darioterios</a> says, he looks like he really loves being at the club and wears his heart on his sleeve. That isn't in doubt.

What he does need to prove is his intelligence and positioning, because I imagine much of the criticism directed towards him stems from his apparent rashness. Unlike some, I don't think he's destined to fail; he's only 25, which is young for a centre back, and I think if he can improve the mental side of his game, he could become a really good player for us. There are few centre-backs who aren't vulnerable to concentration issues (Mr Ferdinand certainly had a few) and the likes of Gary Cahill and Laurent Koscielny have shown that you need time to improve in that area.

35~~~
Anderson 2.0

36~~~
Fortunately Snake didnt turn his head.

37~~~
The guy loves being at United, he's so passionate as well. 

No worries over this Argie.

38~~~
He could be bloody good if only he was any kop at playing football.

39~~~
He does look a bit a stocky in those training pics. Wouldn't surprise me if he doesn't figure for a while and LVG puts him on a specialised training regime.

40~~~
He's more talented than Jones or Smalling and it'll show this season.

41~~~
You can't survive on talent alone

42~~~
I can't see real talent in him, especially with what he did last season. Jones when he came showed great talent, but then get worse and worse. But Rojo is an average player. He can/be a backup to the starters no more

43~~~
I like rojo, for some reason he just gives of the vibe that he'd go as far as kidnapping for the club.

He's hard as nails to, hoping this is a good season for him.

44~~~
This place is the epicenter of anorexia in the world, everyone is fat or gained weight.

45~~~
Too fat/bulk up.

Standard.

46~~~
Seems like something of a forgotten man as far as our centreback options go among fans this summer. He's surely preferred to Blind as our left footed option. There's no reason he couldn't form a fantastic partnership with Smalling. Albeit not quite there yet, they have a bit of Ferdinand and Vidic to them.

47~~~
I agree, and hope Van Gaal puts him instead of Blind in Friday's lineup. Rojo gets underrated on here, and is our best current CB apart from Smalling in my opinion.

48~~~
I thought the Smalling - Rojo partnership looked pretty good last season. Rojo a bit shaky at times but United were still quite defensively sound. I certainly hope he comes in to replace Blind when he's fit.

49~~~
His tackle against Yaya Toure was outstanding, his best moment for us. People were crying penalty but he GOT the ball!!!

50~~~
I think it's the best partnership we got too. And fits the whole right foot/left foot defense. I really like Rojo, his one on one skills are very good.

51~~~
How have you come to that conclusion?

52~~~
The problem is though unless Blind is injured or has an absolute howler he might not, LvG seems to want to shoehorn Blind into the team whenever he is available, the midfield in now locked for him, and unless Shaw gets injured then so in the LB position.

Maybe I'm doing Blind a disservice but other than having a cool head, and having the eye for a pass he seems to have non of the attributes to be a top defender.

53~~~
The only attributes that he lacks his patience, he tends to chase the ball everywhere, it was bothering for a midfielder and it's idiotic for a centerback. But I'm sure, he will fix that.
Though Rojo is a better CB, he is faster, stronger and more confident.

54~~~
He hasn't the discipline for central defence. Or the awareness.

Hes not a bad left back, not as good as Shaw or Blind though.

55~~~
I quite enjoyed watching Smojo around last winter. I'd like to see more of that pairing again when Rojo is fit.

56~~~
Really? I thought he was our best CB at times last year, given that if was his first season in a new league, couldn't speak the language and had just come off a hard fought World Cup campaign (in which he got into the team of the tournament) that's not a bad achievement. 
I've no idea why you said he doesn't have the awareness or dicipiline to play CB, it seems to be the go to criticism when someone doesn't actually know why they don't like a certain player.

57~~~
And new league / language is a go to defence <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Thats my opinion. I don't dislike him. Hes just not good enough for central defence in my opinion. He seems very rash to me.

58~~~
It's not, it's fact. Further, I didn't use it as a defence for his performances. I used it in spite off.

59~~~
Ok. I'm not really up for arguing about someone who is going to be a fringe player at best. And rightfully so. You're clearly a big fan of his to drag me here from another thread. I think we'll have to agree to disagree and leave it at that.

60~~~
I "dragged" you here from the Twitter thread as the talk in that thread has to be about tweets, this discussion obviously isn't. As for being a big fan? No, I think he's had a decent first season, and I'm more than willing to give him a second season to show his true worth. Many posters write off a player before they've saw him play, or simply because they aren't a big enough name. I guess thats the way football is going.

61~~~
Agreed. If it were up to RedCafe we would have replaced Vidic and Evra long ago.

62~~~
Saw him play every game last season. Quite a few at OT. Smalling is hardly a big name but i like him. 

I hope Rojo proves me wrong. Don't see it happening.

63~~~
Indeed.

64~~~
He's better than blind so he should therefore start when fit

65~~~
But worse than Jones, rather even have Carrick as CB than Rojo.

66~~~
didnt do much wrong last season. whats your issue with him at CB?

67~~~
He's rash, positioning not great, invites danger, even though he's tall not a very good header of the ball, and his reading of the game isnt that good for a defender. Squad player at best for me, has good physique and is quite comfortable on the ball.

68~~~
I disagree with the he's rash bit. He seemed everything but that last season. Maybe he was all these things @ sporting but definitely not for us. Almost sounds like you described Jones.

69~~~
I think he will become our first choice CB alongside Smalling this season. Hes fearless, good on the ball and extremely motivated. There have been top class defenders working with less than that in the past.

Jones has more talent but not the brain for it.

70~~~
Is this the Rojo thread or the Jones thread?

71~~~
I think rojo &  jones make great partners if partnered with a 'softer DM'  like carrick.  However if we play a fluid back line of smalling &  Blind then we need a tough bastard in the centre covering them; someone like schneiderlin but i dont think he is ready yet.

72~~~
Phil Jones you're talking about, right?

73~~~
Rojo is our worst CB. Don't understand how people can call Jones rash and clumsy and then praise Rojo who is much worse without any of the upsides.

Blind > Rojo.

74~~~
Worst CB? 

Man can read a lot of wierd stuff here.

75~~~
They're basically the same. Rojo's much better on the ball though but Jones has a few years on him.

76~~~
Jones in a decent run is a cracking defender, only that de decent runs arent frequent. I am yet to be really impressed by Rojo to be fair.

77~~~
He's the kind of player I hope gets better. Seems like he likes a scrap, and could be extremely dislikeable if you didn't support us. We still need more of these.

78~~~
I like him, thought he did ok in his first season, without being excellent. A few mistakes here and there but not much more than Jones.
I like his attitude, and he likes a duel, he has that bit of Vidic about him, although he can be a bit rash (which he needs to improve)

All in all though, especially in the FA cup games vs the lower teams, you could see he relishes a duel, and that hes not the type of defender to get bullied. I think with a bit of work, he could make a good defender, especially if Smalling turns out to be a leader who can work with him.

Also he is very good on the ball too, and left footed.

79~~~
Where is he btw? Is he back in Manchester or still stuck in Argentina with passport problems?

80~~~
In Manchester getting his fitness back.

81~~~
No idea but wouldn't put it past Van Gaal to have taken the huff with him for a while.

82~~~

Who is Marcos Rojo? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

85~~~
Beta version

86~~~
I wonder how he's going to respond to playing second fiddle to Blind

87~~~
At this point he is cover for Blind and Shaw. He will need to make a step up from his previous level if he is going to oust them.

88~~~
I suspect he'll get back into the team once van Gaal deems him fit enough to play

89~~~
Over Blind? Im sorry but I don't think that will happen considering how well Blind has started with Smalling. It wouldn't be right or fair in all honesty

90~~~
Don't think he'll kick up too much of a fuss. He'll still get plenty of games, as he can cover both, LCB and LB.

91~~~
Did he travel to Brugge?

92~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

93~~~
What the feck is going on with him?

94~~~
Played 60 minutes against Ajax in midweek.

95~~~
Starts for the Argos tonight.. Hopefully he's full fit and trained now ´cause we really need him to step up.

96~~~
Considering how badly Blind has played at international duty (well the whole Dutch team played badly except Memphis), Rojo is just one 'Blind mistake for us' away from getting into the side. Some tough games coming up for Blind and if he fails, I hope Rojo can step up and take his place. He can be a good foil for Smalling and can really learn a thing or two from him.

97~~~
Starts for Argentina

98~~~
Wondering what reason will be this time for not coming back to England on time.

99~~~
I liked him last season in the Centre but he was poor at LB. 

I rate him above Jones actually. I don't think we need another CB at all. It will be interesting to see how he kicks on on his second season for us. I have high hopes.

100~~~
He is in a very bad position, now that it seems we found our back four, it will be very complicated for him to play regularly.

101~~~
Right now yes, but it would have to take the miracle of Smalling not getting injured all season to stop him getting back in the side.

102~~~
Did Blind point towards Rojo to mark Narsingh for the 2nd goal?

103~~~
It looked like Rojo's fault positionally to me.

104~~~
I knew before the cross arrived that he was in a bad position.

105~~~
What was blind doing?

106~~~
It's a communication issue no doubt. I'm pretty sure Rojo looks slightly over his shoulder and expects Blind to take care of Narsingh.

107~~~
I think he's an awful player although I guess this being is first game is a good excuse. Where the feck is Jones?

108~~~
If LVG keeps him in the team once Jones comes back for the Right foot left foot thing, i'd be mighty pissed.

109~~~
His first game though. Now that he gets some games, we can see how good he is now

110~~~
Came on in difficult circumstances with very little playing time under his belt, I was actually surprised he didn't go to LB. He started off with a couple of nervy passes but I thought he played ok as the game went on.

111~~~
Not going to fully blame him. I do think making him CB instead of LB was a bit of a crazy decision. We didnt need that interruption imo as it ruins communication which is what happened in the end.

112~~~
It makes no sense that he didn't come on at LB... bizarre decision.

He looked very rusty.

113~~~
Ye goal wasn't his fault. Sloppy play from Darmian and it's an excellent cross. Blind could possibly have been closer but we got caught on the back foot and had little time to react.

Thought he played fine and glad we have him now Shaw's out.

114~~~
I felt it was a solid enough performance from Rojo on his sudden return.

115~~~
Oh look at that, people are out to blame him already. This was his first game in the first team since last season! 

The goal was lost because Darmian gave it away and the cross was amazing. The guy who crossed it couldn't have crossed it any better.

116~~~
Can't blame him at all really. He did fine for his first game back in ages.

I expect him to start more games at CB now, unless Jones becomes fit. He's clearly not a terrible player, he looked great for Argentina, so I'm hoping to see him improve with us.

117~~~
On that particular play, Blind already made the call to Rojo and asked him to cover the man first. The fact that Rojo completely ignored the warning makes him as guilty as Darmian (if not more) for allowing that play to unfold. All that was asked from him was to do the right little things rather than trying to go for a Hollywood clearance that nobody gives a shit about. My feelings towards Rojo after tonight can be summed up by Alec Baldwin's reaction here (language included):

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aj6PSpUNjU4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

118~~~
Rojo was at fault.

He saw that Blind was beaten by the attacker so should have ran towards the back post and attacked the ball from there. Instead he went towards the front post and got caught under the ball.

119~~~
There was a guy behind Rojo too. If for example the cross is shorter and Rojo goes back post, that guy has a free header and probably scores too. I think Rojo tried to be in the most optimum position to defend the ball i.e where he could deal with both players running in -  He got done by the cross. This happens to the best of them! Rio thought he had Messi covered in Rome. Only for Xavis cross to be inch perfect and delete him from the equation. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pe15uHGeKVU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

120~~~
Had a decent game, all things considered.

121~~~
I hope to see him partner Smalling now. Needs game but I rate him and really think he could have a good season. Rusty though but only way to get rid of that is by playing.

122~~~
People have to consider, it's his first game from last season.

123~~~
Have to say the thought of this fills me with dread. Can't think of a single game where he impressed me as a CB. Reckless and no sense of defensive positioning. He makes Phil Jones look composed in comparison. 

 Slightly stronger and quicker than Blind but not even a fraction of the intelligence and ability on the ball that has made Blind such a useful players for us so far this season. Blind and Jones should both be ahead of Rojo in the CB pecking order. McNair too IMHO.

124~~~
Thought he did well last season there, not great but showed good signs. Thought he handled tough strikers like Drogba very well. No doubt Blind is far more intelligent but as an out and out defender, I really think Rojo has something.

Jones would be 50/50 for me over Rojo but McNair is way off starting every week over him in my opinion.

125~~~
Drogba's a shadow of his former self and my main memory of Rojo against Chelsea was getting rinsed by Hazard with a wild lunge at the edge of the box. I always try to look at the positives with new signings but this bloke has never looked even close to good enough. At least giving McNair games will have benefits in the long-term.

126~~~
Probably being harsh but I genuinely think he's an awful defender. Need Jones back ASAP.

127~~~
I'm with you. Again, feel like I'm being really harsh on the bloke... and it is genuinely great that he seems to love being at United so much, but I really couldn't tell you one thing that he's very good at.

Yet, there are people on this forum who believe that he's better then Jones, so you know, maybe we're wrong.

128~~~
Of course it wasn't Drogba of 5 years ago but he was still in good shape last season and played well against us but Rojo dealt quite well I thought.

No doubt Rojo can be rash but I also think that is one of his strengths, he is a winner and wants to win everything, just needs to pick when to and when not to. He is still young and will learn.

There is no rush with McNair to give him games, sure it would be good to see but as long as he is in and around picking up a few games here and there, I'm not worried about his long term future. In 3 or so years, that's when he needs to be playing.

129~~~
He's not as bad as people are making out to be, can't really think of too many major mistakes he's made since he's been here.

130~~~
What did he do wrong yesterday to warrant this criticism?

131~~~
I simply don't understand how people have made their minds up and concluded that Rojo is a terrible defender. I agree with Pogue that Blind is a far more intelligent player (he's probably more intelligent than all our players bar Carrick and Schweinsteiger) but it's not like Rojo is a piece of piss, he's an actual defender and he's done well for Argentina IMV. 

I'd throw McNair in there as he looks like he can become a serious top class defender and with such a stable back 4 that can only bring him on. But if he's not deemed ready I don't see how Rojo is a poor option. Evan's was not good enough and he'd been here for years and didn't make the grade. Jones is capable of becoming a top defender, but it's risky counting on him in a settled back 4 given that he's injured half the time, which of course counts against him.

132~~~
Well he has played 25 games for us... thats enough to have informed an opinion on him, whether you think he's good or bad.

133~~~
Alot of knee-jerk reactions but this is the cafe and so expected. Give him a few games and more than a few will be eating their words.

134~~~
I don't think he was very good today, but I actually thought he was better then Blind when he went to left back.

135~~~
Thought his passing was supposed to be really good. Very sloppy on the ball.

136~~~
He left Blind too isolated at times, which isn't all on him as we have to watch that aspect due to Blind's physical limitations so it impedes the LB's role, but Shaw did it so well that other than against Swansea it went unhindered. I can't deny he makes me nervous.

137~~~
He's not very inspiring at LB, nor CB for that matter. Just very average.

138~~~
Needs more game time and just like Romero, didn't had a pre-season this year so the rust is not really that surprising.

Can't wait for Louie to say that he needs to 'build him'... feckin Bob.

139~~~
He wasn't good but playing him at CB might have been better but he still doesn't really convince me as a top CB

140~~~
Any idea why he was subbed off? Injury or tactical?

141~~~
Thought he was fine. He is definitely not a left back

142~~~
all the terrible defender business is a bit odd. but it's probably because he's measured on a different scale to your McNairs etc.
McNair being a home grown guy, will get more sympathy for the same sort of display.

Probably best putting both in against Ipswich. Both need a game, and for certain Smalling needs to be saved for the bigger games as if he's out for a while we're really screwed.

143~~~
In the first half he was absolute crap. 
-He failed to close down the guy who put in the cross that led to the goal.
-He made a bunch of silly passes
-He resorted to crossing into the box aimlessly from a long way out
-He missed a simple pass to Rooney who had ample space in front of and and decided to pass it back all the way to Depay

He was the worst player on the pitch that half;fortunatly, he grew into the game in the second half. His defending became much better, as he closed down wingers much better and he started to make better passes. It didn't make much sense why Van Gaal replaced him when he started playing well.

He looks clearly in need of consistent game time if we want to see the best of him imo.

144~~~
He isn't and unless things drastically change, isn't going to be one either. I'm just hoping we get a solid squad option out of him.

145~~~
Yeah, one of his main issues seems to stem from the lack of communication..

146~~~
Still think he can do well at the club. He's been out for a long time and has to get used to the style of play and the intensity of the league again.  So so sloppy in the first half but he did better in the 2nd. 

He'll come good after more game time, I'm sure of it.

147~~~
I can totally understand LvG's thinking in keeping Blind at CB and Rojo LB for this game given that Blind has been playing well there and it's particularly important to have stability at the back. After today it shouldn't happen anymore. Rojo is too clumsy and technically lacking to attack effectively and Blind's physical limitations as a CB are obvious. If he doesn't switch them I'll be disappointed.

148~~~
Looked a bit rusty today but grew into the game. At least he'll get a run of games now.

149~~~
I hope so. Think last season gave us some nice Smalling + Rojo glimpses.

150~~~
I'm not that keen on him as a LB even though I felt he should've stayed in the game.  He is not very good coming forward on the wing for how decent he is with the ball and his inability to make solid runs like Shaw forced Memphis to drop into the middle third too many times.  He also tends to linger upfield instead of dropping back into position.  I think he is much better as a CB.  The problem is, Blind is too slow to play LB.

151~~~
Thought he was good today for the most part, especially for someone who was making his first start of the season. Find it strange that most of the caf have decided he's shit when he's usually been reliable for us.

152~~~
Done well covering round the back when a cross came in and got more minutes under his belt.

His little chipped pass to Mata in the build up to our goal was good too.

153~~~
With how well Shaw was playing - literally our best attacking player for most games all the way from LB - Rojo was always going to be filling some big boots. Think he should play LB against Ipswich again. Let him take that position all season until Shaw is back, really.

154~~~
He needs a proper run of games. Must remember that he virtually missed the entire pre-season. In the longer term, I see him as a CB though.

155~~~
Not sure whether he is the type of thinking defender that van Gaal seems to favour. However, Shaw is injured, McNair is poor at defending, and Jones is not fit yet, so this is Rojo's chance.

156~~~
Give him time and he will come good. He hadnt kicked a ball in anger in months and he was still reasonable. He was fine last year and as a LB he kept far better players than he will face most weeks in the Premier League quiet at the World Cup.

157~~~
Injured

158~~~
Tight hammy. Figures, we need to start playing Rojo more and he gets himself hurt. The curse of the MU Defenders strikes again. 3 defenders down in the course of 5 days, with McNair picking up a knock. Figure Valencia will need to come in for Darmian, who'll get shifted to the left. Maybe Young gets to play LB in the Cap One Cup tomorrow to rest Darmian? Either way, we'll have at least 2 midfielders playing in the back 4, maybe 3. 

LVG don't sound too happy with Rojo not taking himself out sooner. Good way to get yourself in the doghouse. Considering the relative lack of rest until the next international break, a really bad time for another left-footed defender to get hurt. Heck, sounds like Jones will have to be named to the bench to make up the numbers, unless LVG is ready to blood Varela.

159~~~
Hasn't played much so it's no surprise.

160~~~
Reports that he has fallen out with LVG again for keeping his current injury secret before the Southampton game

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-facing-defensive-crisis-6494362" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-facing-defensive-crisis-6494362</a>

Fuming <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/louis-van-gaal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Louis van Gaal</a> is facing a defensive crisis after what appears another fall out with Marcos Rojo.

But the Argentina defender insisted on Tuesday evening he will not leave Old Trafford, despite his fractured relationship with the manager.

The <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a> defender was banished to the wilderness at the start of the season after failing to turn up for the final leg of the club’s summer tour, because he forgot to get his passport visa renewed.

Yet after forcing his way back into the starting line up following injury to Luke Shaw, the Argentine defender is now sidelined again... after failing to tell the United bench he was injured at Southampton last Sunday.

A clearly unimpressed Van Gaal revealed he now has a major defensive headache with Shaw out, Phil Jones not ready to start and Paddy McNair also injured at the weekend.

161~~~
Harsh...Maybe he didnt think it was serious.

162~~~
Confusing. Was he injured before the game or during it?

163~~~
Well, that didn't take long!  Maybe we should have tried harder to sign Otamendi!

164~~~
Seems he will be out of the revolving door next sometime in the next year or so.

Interesting who plays tomorrow ? Tuanzebe on the bench ?

165~~~
Sorry, during the game

166~~~
So a defensive injury crisis again? Good that we didnt pursue an attainable CB then...

167~~~
I think that's paper talk tbh. Putting 2 and 2 together and coming up with the square root of pi.

168~~~
Rojo is probably getting on van Gaal's tits. Passports, issues in Argentina, abysmal fitness. 

So given this and, as we are only in September and down to the bare bones of a defence, it seem odd we let Evans and Blackett go and brought in no one else.

169~~~
The exchange between LvG and Rojo seemed friendly enough when he came off the other day, at any rate even if he has pissed the manager off we are going to need to use him this season.

170~~~
Definitely.A Blind injury and we'll have to start him (almost) every game.

171~~~
It's unbelievable that we are on the brink of another defensive crisis and have 2 less CB's than last season.

172~~~
Tbf Blackett hardly featured last season since we start to play 4 at the back and Blind can be seen as a "replacement" for Evans with Morgan the replacement for the "midfielder Blind".

We too often have 3 or more CBs out injured at the same time it's unbelievable.Our number would be fine if it was another club.

173~~~
That's true I guess, and of course the Shaw injury has now set up a situation where Blind will again be spread between two positions.

It certainly feels like a curse at this point, LvG shouldn't have mentioned the less injuries stuff the other day. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

174~~~

175~~~
Tomorrow's news will be that he is in LvG's bad books because he had a coffee with cream and sugar even though he was asked to drink black coffee without sugar.

176~~~
Hmmm Carrick at CB again perhaps?

177~~~
After all this time we might still have to resort to Carrick at CB. Pretty amazing.

178~~~
I can't believe LVG didn't sort out the defensive problems we've had and now once again already have. We can only pray and knock on wood that Blind and Smalling stay healthy for the next couple of crucial games. Except Valencia they are all injury-prone. <b>We</b> knew that but I can't understand LVG's stubbornness in that regard. If this story about Rojo is true, then he should piss off. Such kind of attitude doesn't help the team in any way. Read somewhere in the newspaper that we're in for Cresswell. United class or not. We desperately need someone on the left. said that in another thread, we should go out next summer to sort out our defensive-crises. One of the top-targets should be David Alaba. He can pretty play everywhere and is right now the best left-back in the world. Probably Bayern wouldn't be interested in selling us but we should try. Take the fecking war-chest and get us 3 classy defenders. The sooner the better. This crisis can ruin our title challenge once again. Like last year's September and October!

179~~~
how dare LVG get Shaw and Jones injured! He's such a prick! <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

180~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

181~~~
Where did I say that he's to blame for Shaw's injury? I only said we're missed out to sort our injury-prone defense. And that's a fact. We're pretty solid atm but 3 injuries once again and huge matches ahead of us.

I wanna have a laugh too! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Can't wait till the next injury and LVG is playing Carrick at the back and everybody is at panic mode. That's laughable!

182~~~
LVG has chosen Blind as a CB this season.
That means we have five CBs-> Smalling, Jones, Blind, Rojo and three full backs -> Shaw Darmian Valencia. That is 8 players in defence for four positions.
One can complain about the quality of the players and suggest we should have bought this defender or that. But how can we complain that we are short in numbers?
We have had this situation when we have so many experienced defenders too, one can't help it with the injuries.
Some might argue that with the injury record Smalling and Jones had, we should have had others in. Well in that case, I am not sure we would have ever seen Chris evolve into Mike. I also feel, Jones will show that is a great player for us, this year or the next.

183~~~
I just checked Rojo is expected to be back from his hamstring injury on October 17th. That long? Wow. I thought it was a small injury.
I am glad Jones is getting back. I hope to see him play at CB soon.

184~~~

Burnt....Just like his football career <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

185~~~
did he go for the argentina games?
i really want to see the following back four against Everton,
Darmian Smalling Jones Rojo
Everton are no Arsenal, but I expect them to come at us, we need to be solid avoid conceding.
Jones and Rojo need to start becoming a part of the squad now. Let's hope they get a look in and stay fit.

186~~~
Very good today.

#RojoisRed

187~~~
Excellent game from him

188~~~
Not sure why van Gaal wants to sell him, played very well today.

189~~~
can't understand why people on here think Rojo shit......

190~~~
He was very good

191~~~
Very good today. Was extremely composed in the face of speedy merchants like Lukaku and Lennon.

192~~~
Very good performance from him today

193~~~
Did really well today bar that one lapse of concentration. A good reminder that he's not as shit as this forum decided he was over the summer for no apparent reason.

194~~~
He's a poor centre back in my opinion. Good on the left

195~~~
Fantastic performance. More aggression and confidence than what we've seen before.

196~~~
I'm not his biggest fan, but very impressed by him today. Especially considering he's usually a postional liability, he dealt with everything - even Lukaku - extremely well.

197~~~
Very decent but credit to Martial ahead of him, who gave him plenty of cover (on Coleman).

198~~~
Perhaps the best Rojo has played at full back for United? Even his fouls were the right decisions. What a cross for Herrera's goal too.

199~~~
Well you can always upgrade but selling him to get Indi would be stupid.

200~~~
I've always like him. I reckon LVG will forgive him a bit more now. We need him guys....we really do.

201~~~
His best performance in a United shirt. Very good against two pacey players in Coleman and Lennon, and then against Delaxxxu.

Don't like at CB at all but can play a role at LB in Shaw's absence.

202~~~
Looks like we've got out back four sorted for a while anyway.

Can see Blind coming back in (at centre-back) against weaker opposition at home, but otherwise this looks pretty good.

203~~~
It's one of the more baffling trends on the Caf.

The less he's played the worse he has become. I recall that he was in good form up until the injury he picked up towards the end of last season. He barely kicked a ball after that because Smalling and Jones were in good form.

Rojo is a good option to have here. He's no world beater, but he's solid, fairly experienced and versatile.

204~~~
Had a poor 15 mins at the start of the 2nd half, apart from that he was excellent. Super cross for Herrera's goal.

205~~~
He played very well today but I wasn't surprised. I think he can play like that consistently if he keeps fit and we're lucky to have him with Shaw getting such a bad injury. I'm one of the few who don't really understand why he gets so much hate.

206~~~
Good player and has always been decent for us, never understood the stick he gets on here.

207~~~
Easily his best game for us, did nothing wrong. Just need him to keep this up for us. 

Wonder if having Smalling on his side helped?

208~~~
Good game

209~~~
He does that for his country, if he can do it for United regularly then perhaps no more shit talk about Argies being flops in United ?

There's still time for even further improvement as he's not even at the peak age for a footballer. Good to have him as an option along with even younger Jones surviving injuries like soldier on a battlefield.

210~~~
I am not a fan of Rojo, but he played well today and defended well too. Hopefully keeps it up.

211~~~
As a Rojo supporter (compared to the unusual comments he gets on here), very satisfied with that performance. Arguably MOTM. 

He's a good player and he's here to stay.

#RojoisRed

212~~~
Arguably his best performance for us, composed on the ball and cut out the rash positional lapses, plus his one on one defending against both Everton RW options was very good.

213~~~
What gives with the commentators on my stream who kept calling him Rocko?

214~~~
I am a fan of him, good to see him back and performing well again!

215~~~
what is this talk he may be leaving?

216~~~
Such a better name. Kudos to them.

217~~~
Yup proved the haters wrong. 

Before doubting Rojo's long term future just remember Vidic and Evra's first 6 months with us...

218~~~
You got your wish and they were great!

219~~~
I don't get the hate for him either, he can play centre back well enough and left back too, obviously he isn't Shaw or Smalling but we also need squad players! I think he's a very good squad player due to his versatility just like Blind is. And I have no problem with him or Blind as left back for the rest of the season, inevitably injuries will happen and that's for all the clubs, you just want a player who can come in and perform well enough.

220~~~
Going out on a limb and reitirating something I've said elsewher, Rojo and Smalling should be our defence. It's a shame Shaw isn't fit as Rojo is probably the best option for left back.

221~~~
That cross was amazing. Very good defensively too, apart from a shaky start to the second half.

222~~~
He wasn't playing which obviously means you are on the way out. The media just fail to realize some players get injured and can't play.

223~~~
thought the commentator said this. Hate to lose him.

224~~~
Yeah, they are saying it but it doesn't make it true. If he was on the way out he wouldn't be starting games over Blind. He fecked up the passport shit and hasn't been playing so the media assume he must be on his way out. The truth is they haven't a clue what is going on with Rojo and are only linking us with Indi because he is dutch and goes with the other 20 dutch players we've been linked to.

225~~~
at least we have options at LB (Rojo and Blind) instead of Young ffs.

We should be well covered there until Shaw returns.

226~~~
At the very least he can be a very good squad player for us. But hopefully he'll be more than that... he's only 25.

227~~~
A very good performance from Rojo. Really want him to make LB position his until Shaw returns. Blind can take some Cup games but Rojo should be a starter. His crossing today was immense. Although he is brash and is a penalty/red card waiting to happen, that is his style and get's the most out of him that way.

228~~~
Good performance, probably his best so far this season. He needs to be more consistent though, he'll put in a performance like this and then regress in the next match. Think Rojo's a useful option to have but I still have Blind ahead of him in the pecking order for both CB and LB.

229~~~
Thought he was great. Some great one on one defending and I thought he gave us good balance in both attack and defence. I do prefer him at CB and don't think he is a natural LB but obviously can do a job there. So with the current situation, Rojo being fit is key.

230~~~
One or two mistakes otherwise top notch.

231~~~
I don't get why people do not think he's good. He's been good overtime he's played at left back for us.

232~~~
Such a baffling thing with English commentators. It drives me crazy how they'd pronounce 'Javier' as 'Hav-i-eh,' or the over stressing of the first syllable in 'Martinez.'

233~~~
But how do they arrive at Rocko from Rojo? A genuine mystery

234~~~
did fine , great ball in for ander's goal.

235~~~
Had a very good game. He defended well, tidy in possesion, and provided a very good cross.

236~~~
I know :-)
I was shocked when the line up was announced and buzzing too.
Hope this back four can get a run and do well

237~~~
Because in Spanish the J is scraped, and people who aren't comfortable doing that sometimes just do a hard K sound instead

238~~~
Superb assist to Herrera.  I still think he is Smalling's best partner but he can do the job at LB as well.  A very, very underrated player for us.

239~~~
That cross<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

240~~~
A great performance by Marcos, who's much better suited to play LB than CB.  We'll miss Shaw but Rojo will de Eloy into a fantastic regular at left back for us.

241~~~
Its his style. Despite never having made any glaring mistakes, he is a bit manic and some think that means hes no good. Im not sure hes a long term starter but hes not an Evans style liability like some think. He just needs to pick his passes a little better at times and know when to stay on his feet when he goes flying in.

Hes part of the reason LVG didnt really chase a CB over the summer. Between Smalling, Blind, Jones and Rojo we have four very good options.

242~~~
I disagree. I've actually not been a fan of him being at left back. He was particularly awful at Leicester last season. I'm not just singling him out there, but he was awful going forward and back. If I recall correctly he gave the ball away a lot. I'm sure there were other games where he didn't impress there either (wish there was a site showing what position players played in in particular matches then I'd know for sure).

I do remember he was very good against Arsenal at home in the league at left back towards the back end of last season. Excellent cross yesterday of course as well.

243~~~
Transfermarkt, although I'm not sure they are always correct but you can click on the match to see the lineup and usually figure it out.

244~~~
He's inconsistent at left back, doesn't seem to matter what type of winger he's up against, but he can look class one day and shite the next day out there against the same type of player. But he's a good player for sure. He won't ever be an automatic starter, but he's a very good squad player to have I think, as he is a good center back and a decent left back and will always give his all. I hope the stories about us looking to sell aren't true because you won't find many players who are willing to be squad players who can play as well as he can at both left back and center back, and is still pretty young.

Saying that, I don't think we've seen him at his best yet, as he's had some pretty bad luck with injuries while he's been at United and has struggled to have a long run where he is free of injuries.

245~~~
Thanks. Just what I was after.

246~~~
Rojo getting praise from LvG and Wayne Rooney:

247~~~
You are missing a little out of the story, the Russian press actually took the piss saying to Rooney "How many times do you go passed him in training, as everybody else in Russia seemed too". And they quite openly asked what LVG saw in him, as he was pretty rubbish in Russia. Quite insulting really, I hope Rojo personally smashes 1 in the top corner tonight.

248~~~
Yep, I definitely didn't know that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I guess they were forced to defend him. I thought it may have just been praise and encouragement based on his decent performance on Saturday.

249~~~
Yeah, rarely do we talk about individuals but we had to defend him there, they were slaughtering him. No doubt he probably had a poor time in Russia but I imagine he just didn't play his best as it's a rubbish league. If he continues his Everton form he will make them eat their words.

250~~~
Quashes the rumour that he's going to be sold in January. Something I thought was madness.

251~~~
The Russian journalists seemed to be having a real go at him. I'd expect LVG and Rooney to defend him, even if they don't actually think he's good enough.

252~~~
I hope Rojo doesn't lose the rag because of this. Seems like quite an emotional fella. If he goes out there trying to prove a point too much, he might cough up chances by over-committing and/or end up getting sent off.

253~~~
Seems unnecessarily mean. I just had a quick look and he only made 8 appearances for Spartak when he was 21.

254~~~
The lack of overlapping runs was very disappointing today

255~~~
I thought he was shite. I miss Shaw <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

256~~~
He's so inconsistent.

257~~~
Was terrible in this aspect today. Didn't offer Martial any support.

258~~~
Clear communication issues with Martial causing a disconnect between the 2. Didn't seem keen to overlap though tonight. Didn't do huge amounts wrong but didn't offer what he could/should have or what is expected at this level when chasing a game.

259~~~
1 step forward against Everton, 1 step back tonight, he looked on edge the whole time.

260~~~
I have no issues with Rojo on the whole but this was a major problem tonight. Whether it was tactical or not I'm not sure, but he stifled our left flank.

261~~~
He could have been instructed to stay back and hold back on his runs forward.

262~~~
I have a feeling this was the case.

263~~~
he had a great game against Eerton but he never looked good enough going forward for us tonight and never before. I would actually consider taking someone like coentrao on loan in winter. Now we actually miss Evra

264~~~
I've just remembered that attempted 'header' where it landed on his hand. What actually was that?

265~~~
Worst game by a distance for us, never been convinced by him as a full back.

266~~~
He wasn't awful, even though that attempted header was dire. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He needed to get up the line and push the full back deep and link up with Martial more, like he did against Everton but for some reason didn't. Definitely seems more tactical to me, but he wasn't garbage or whatever will no doubt be posted.

267~~~
I like Rojo but tonight, out there, he looked... confused. It seems like many times he was caught in two minds.

268~~~
He was absolutely horrendous. As he has been almost every time he's played at LB for United (not that he's been much better in the centre)

269~~~
I guess the clothing company named "Bench" can start using him as their representative because that's where he's going for a while.

Jeez, he was totally horrible tonight. How in the world can this guy keep his LB spot with Argentina and yet provide nothing to support his winger on the attack?

270~~~
We miss Shaw

271~~~
Headless chicken performance

272~~~
Shitting his pants at the sheer thought of supporting Martial was just pathetic.

273~~~
He's not got enough up top to be a van Gaal type player, too reliant on old fashioned blood and thunder. Blind and Jones are better options in his preferred positions. Great cross against Everton, though, for Herrera's goal.

274~~~
Thought he was very disappointing tonight, hope van Gaal drops him and plays Blind at LB this weekend.

275~~~
He was pretty shite last night, but unfortunately I can't say I was surprised by his performance.

276~~~
Too soon to judge, and I reckon he will better as a CB, but he looks like an average player.

277~~~
Same here, especially when you consider we had a winger as the other fullback. Having both fullbacks bombing on in a tough away match would be suicidal.

I think people are far too harsh on our defenders on here, and Rojo in particular. I didn't think he was great tonight but he certainly wasn't terrible like some are making out.

278~~~
Yes he was poor tonight but do you really want our back four changed again, in such a big match? Putting Blind against Navas/Sterling/Nasri would be bonkers, considering how Arsenals pace tore us a new one. I'd give Rojo the City game to pull it back round, he'll be fired up for it. 

I don't fault Rojo much for not overlapping, we were 1-0 down away from home and they had some pacey players, that looked threatening on the counter.

279~~~
Arsenal's quicker players were allowed far too much space in which to operate because van Gaal decided it would be a good idea to have two sitting midfielders with barely any pace between them press high as they tried to play it out from the back. It was in my opinion the worse tactical display by LvG since he took over, surely we'll play our Scheneiderlin/Schweinsteiger/Herrera trio so that won't happen again.

As for Blind, he played well there in the game against them last season at home. I think it was Navas he was up against on that occasion who is quick, though to be fair we set up with Young on the left wing who will track back and cover. In contrast, Memphis was abysmal at helping out the full back in the game at the Emirates. I've just never been particularly happy with Rojo in that left back spot it has to be said, but I can see why you're arguing that he should start.

280~~~
I think he was. Blind was also quite central and deep at times.

281~~~
Rojo never overlaps, its nothing new. He offered nothing going forward last season and other than the assist he didn't really attack much against Everton either.

282~~~
Thought he was our worst performer. Lucky to have not given away a penalty with that attempted header.

283~~~
Poor overall. CSKA got joy down his flank a few times, including for the penalty incident, and he offered absolutely nothing going forward. It might be partly tactical, but he'd often pass forward to Martial and then himself retreat as if to tell the CSKA defence, don't worry about me, all you need to be focusing on is Martial there. If he'd even feinted some forward/inside runs it would have helped.

284~~~
Hes naturally a centre back, so hes never going to attack the way Shaw does. Blind doesnt do it much and neither did Smalling/Jones when theyve played there. Theyre all reluctant to go forward beyond a certain point.

285~~~
Rojo is a squad player. Unfortunately we are already well stocked with average defenders who aren't first team level.

286~~~
I disagree on Blind, he got forward plenty last season and demonstrated a great crossing ability. Even from deeper he offers much more attacking threat through his ability on the ball and being able to pick out better options in the middle and through balls. Similar to Smalling and Jones, that is exactly the point, neither of them are good fullbacks and neither offer any attacking prowess from fullback. You combine that with Valencia on the other side and it just isn't good enough.

287~~~
Yeah, Rojo and Jones are fine as squad players but we miss Shaw badly and we need a top CB partner for Smalling.

288~~~
He's in for a tough game against City, if he starts in place of Blind. I don't think LVG was too impressed by his performance against CSKA, so I wouldn't be surprised if Blind got the nod ahead of him. That said, if I were Pellegrini I'd be looking at Rojo as the weak link in that back four and look to utilise Navas's pace on that side as often as possible. With the obvious threat of a breakaway in mind, I can't imagine that Rojo will be offering much support to Martial beyond the pass to feet and cover for loss of possession. Being caught upfield whilst on an overlapping run is a massive risk against the pace of De Bruyne, Sterling and Navas. We'll need to be compact when City are in possession. If Rooney wasn't undroppable I'd play Young on the left and Martial in a CF position, and hope that Rojo's weaknesses might be mitigated by having him tuck in closer to the centrebacks. I imagine that in the absence of Silva and Aguero, City will be happy with a point at Old Trafford, so it's as good an opportunity as any for us to capitalise. I fancy Smalling against Bony, Aguero is a different animal altogether.

289~~~
Brilliant work there.

290~~~
Brilliant

291~~~
He's been great so far.

292~~~
What the hell has happened to him. Fort Knox on the left.

293~~~
MotM for me so far.

294~~~
Brilliant so far.  Shaw-esque.

295~~~
Wow who knew he'd do well in his natural position?

296~~~
It isn't his natural position.

297~~~
He plays there for Argentina and Sporting, no?

298~~~
MOTM so far for me, been great.

For Argentina he has but that's more due to them not having the best options there, he played CB at Sporting and wasn't very convincing when he played left back for them.

299~~~
Superb first half. Gave De Bruyne very little time on the ball and was putting in some excellent challenges. Very impressive.

300~~~
Been brilliant today. De Bruyne is the player I've been worried about but so far he has nullified him.

301~~~
Excellent first half. De Bruyne is in his pocket at the moment.

302~~~
Very good so far, probably our best player.

303~~~
Good half from him. The guy's delivery in comparison to Valencia is a joy to behold.

304~~~
Thought he'd be our weakest link today, he's been excellent hope it continues

305~~~
Not really put a foot wrong yet, but I was worried by how much space De Bruyne had on that attack near the end, which he picked out Yaya for on the return. 9 times out of 10, Yaya strokes those in. Fortunately he scuffed it. Apart from that, De Bruyne hasn't really been able to have an impact. He's had him susses pretty sharpish.

306~~~
Very good first half.

307~~~
KDB on lock down so far.

308~~~
Yeah, that was one instance where De Bruyne was in all that space was very worrying. Had no one near him.

309~~~
De Bruyne is playing into his hand really. Trying to stand him up and take him on 1v1 isn't going to work. Rojo's weakness are interchanges and runs in behind and City aren't doing either which is great for us. Rojo and Valencia for that matter will always do great in 1v1 scenarios.

310~~~
I was concerned about him vs KDB but he's doing very well indeed. Stark contrast to his performance midweek.

311~~~
Good half from him. Keep it up.

312~~~
Has been absolutely fantastic so far. Controlled aggression, energy and discipline too. Please carry this on lad!

313~~~
Our best player with Martial.

314~~~
Feel sorry for the fella, he has to carry an ugly ginger bastard in his pocket with him for the next few months.

My MOTM he was brilliant.

315~~~
Had a great match!

316~~~
Probably my MOTM. He was excellent.

317~~~
Had De Bruyne almost crying. What a beast he was today.

318~~~
Very risky at times and today he got the rewards. There will be games were he will look totally shit because of that.

319~~~
Magnificent performance. Shut that side down. I actually think he's been very good since he became a regular starter.

320~~~
Was so good defensively that De Bruyne didn't exist.

321~~~
The best I have seen him play for us.

322~~~
Excellent defensively. Had De Bruyne in his pocket.

323~~~
Great game for him.

324~~~
Best game for us.

325~~~
Encouraging performence, I reckon he'll grow as the season goes on as well. Could be vital for us that he stays fit.

326~~~
Absolutely sublime. Made a very good player look distinctly average.

327~~~
My MOTM (although Schneiderlin was also good). Excellent defending against a very good player, maybe he could improve his attacking game a bit but since he is a CB its understandable. His crossing is quite decent for a CB though.

328~~~
Probably my MOTM today, won everything that came his way and even put in a few decent crosses. If he can keep that up we'll be fine at left back while we wait for Shaw's return.

329~~~
MOTM today was the most solid performance I've seen from him. Marked KDB out of the game

330~~~
Was excellent.

331~~~
His best game in a United shirt.

332~~~
Very good, kdb in his pocket.

333~~~
Superb today and he's got something we lack all over the pitch - spirit. Pleased for him as he's been written off by quite a lot of people, especially on the Caf

334~~~
His technique of tackle is ridiculous but it's working out for him. he's got good reactions but he needs to stay 100% focused as this type of defending can come costly quite easily.. Last time I've seen aggressive palyer like this was Rafael, and he was fecking great when he was fit, keep it up Marcos The Red!

good techinque on crosses too, he just lacks better dribbling technique for a wide man but right now he seems like a little better option than Blind who would definately struggle against either one of Yaya, de Bruyne or Navas. Rojo coped  really well with all of them..

335~~~
Probably his best game for us. KDB didn't know what hit him

336~~~
Defensively solid and never gave de Bruyne any space. Too bad he can't overlap well.

337~~~
Marcos Rojo's game by numbers vs. Man City: 

100% aerial duels 
5 clearances 
4 crosses 
3 tackles won 
2 interceptions

338~~~
Back to playing like he did against Everton, very strong and disciplined defensively and put in a couple of good deliveries. I don't what happened to him in Moscow on Wednesday.

339~~~
His crossing is pretty good, isn't it?

340~~~
Great game and that performance shows he should be played in the big games when we'll be tested defensively. When playing the weaker sides he's just not good enough going forward to justify his place though. He's a decent passer and a good crosser but regardless of that, he leaves his winger completely isolated far too often for a team like ours.

341~~~
He was clearly told he needs to fly up the flanks and support Martial which he did very well today, unlike his performance vs CSKA when he didn't support Martial. He was also brilliant defensively and dominated De Bruyne. A very good overall performance and probably our MOTM.

342~~~
I'm generally not a fan but was impressed today

343~~~
A good game today and some dangerous crosses as well. The guy must really hate Russia as he turned to sh*t midweek after an equally impressive display against Everton. The entire back four was made up of powerful, athletic players today and there was something reassuring about that in such a game, Bony got bullied where ever he roamed.

344~~~
Played really well today - reminded me of Shaw how he kept winning duels. Probably second best player for us after Schneiderlin for me. Still could have offered more in attack like Valencia was doing from the right.

345~~~
I think <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> is probably shocked by such a performance.

346~~~
He was impressive today, played a couple of good crosses too but we had no one in the box. My Motm

347~~~
He was good but how does it show that? We really weren't tested defensively at all. There was no movement in the City side, Bony was shit and didn't try and move wide or run the channels at all, Sagna doesn't offer anything going forward, Toure was shit and Fernando and Fernandinho are never going to trouble anyone. All he had to deal with was De Bruyne who was also shit but fair enough he is class but it is still much easier to defend when all you are doing is worrying about one man. When we'll be tested defensively he'll have to worry about a lot more which he didn't have to today so I don't see how this shows in anyway he will be able to handle games where we really are tested defensively. I don't mean to take away from his performance as he was good but he wasn't tested today on any of his weaknesses.

348~~~
Sure am. Didn't think he had it in him. Good stuff. More of the same please.

349~~~
He played well against De Bruyne, Bony and Navas. They didn't play well because we defended proactively very well and Rojo was a big part of that.

350~~~
Brilliant performance from him, didn't give De Bruyne a sniff. Needed to be on top form with De Bruyne full of confidence,and he certainly was.

351~~~
Did well but was naughty when Sterling was on the floor and there were a few moments where he found himself out of position. The rest of the team covered him

352~~~
Well deserved for man of the match on here, really impressed with him today. His best match for the club.

353~~~
In addition to his great defending, he has a sweet left foot. His crossing was very good.

354~~~
Is De Bruyne out of his pocket yet?

355~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

356~~~
He's really good on the ball. It's no surprise why LVG bought him to play in the LCB position. It would be interesting to see who would partner Smalling if Shaw was still fit. 

A great game today and he was actually supporting Martial today. Great to see. More of the same vs Palace please.

357~~~
Absolutely perfect performance from him, can't think of one thing he did wrong. Had De Bruyne's number all day long.

358~~~
Hope LvG finally gives him a proper run in the squad. I feared the worse for him after that passport incident.

359~~~
Looks like the solution to our LB position in Shaw's absence. Hope he can keep it up!

360~~~
Needs to give Valencia crossing lessons.

361~~~
I honestly can't remember this lad doing much wrong. He's always had a bad reputation on here but I think he's always been at least solid.

362~~~
I've always liked him, although I thought he needed time to adjust to the pace and aggression of the PL. Yesterday there were signs he's starting to 'get it'. Really pleased for him.

363~~~
Loved the way he and Smalling burst through the pitch a few times and pick out a cross, very capable footballer for a defender..

364~~~
I've been critical of Rojo earlier, but he's done very well at LB and now I think he'll cement that as his position until Shaw is back again.

365~~~
I have been critical too. Still don't want to see him at CB, but he has done very well at LB against both Arsenal and Everton. Hope it continues.

366~~~
Did an excellent job yesterday tbf

367~~~
His crossing is pretty good. He always puts a nice shape on it. I like him at LB.

368~~~
Was my MOTM. Did very well.

369~~~
Sometimes this forum sees what it wants and it takes alot for a player to get in their good graces. Equally when a player is in the forums good graces it takes a while for them to get thrown into the pit <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

370~~~
Great player. Should be a starter for us as CB or LB on a consistent basis.

371~~~
Is Rojo good again? Happy to see that he's improving after all that has happened. Just hope he doesn't forget his passport.

372~~~
Great performance.  I think we're one quality CB signing away from having the backline more or less set for the next couple of seasons.

I really like how athletic Rojo is and his ability to play balls forward is underrated.  It's his movement off the ball both in attack and defense that needs work, but all the physical tools are there in spades for him to establish himself.

373~~~
Some of his passing/crossing was Blind like yesterday

374~~~
I like his crosses. They have this dangerous whip to it.

375~~~
I love players like Rojo. Seems proud to wear the shirt, was desperate to sign for us, and gives his all every single game even if he sometimes makes mistakes. It was a great performance from him at the weekend but he was aided by De Bruyne, a slow enough player, being shunted out wide and having to cut in on his strong side.

It makes a big difference from someone like Memphis who sometimes comes across like he isn't arsed to put in an effort.

376~~~
He was very good yesterday but appaling midweek, for example.

377~~~
Seemed concerned about Walking in Memphis lack of tracking back to sat back most of the time.

378~~~
Doing pretty well. Fair play to him.

379~~~
Solid again.

380~~~
Aye, good performance. My only criticism is him lying on the floor after a knock in the face. You wouldn't have seen Vidic doing that.

381~~~
One of the only good performers out there today

382~~~
Liked him again. Way better than Darmian today.

383~~~
Bolaise got the better of him time and again. Not as shit as Darmian, but not good either.

384~~~
Bolasie is hard to handle when he has one of his good days and he was good today, I thought Rojo managed pretty well overall and importantly maintained discipline positionally and emotionally despite some minor aggro.

385~~~
Putting together some pretty solid defensive performances. Not a bad buy so far.

386~~~
Makes us miss Shaw less and less.

387~~~
Done ok again, been surprised at how well he has coped at LB as he didn't convince me when he played there last season for us. Didn't like the rolling around though.

388~~~
Was up against some players giving him hell but he preformed admirably. Can't complain.

389~~~
Only disappointment I have is that he didn't put in many crosses (not that I remember anyway).

390~~~
Shit crossing.

391~~~
Crossing is normally good, not sure what is going on today.

392~~~
To be fair even Shaws final ball was poor. All our fullbacks have a poor final ball. 

Which is one of the reasons our attack is poor.

393~~~
Dreadful today going forward. Hasn't had anything to do at the back.

394~~~
Shaw often found a player along the ground towards the back of the box.

395~~~
Shaw is much better going forward.

396~~~
One of the main reasons Blind stood out at LB too last season. He offered something the others didn't.

397~~~
Did he play LB often in Portugal? Seems to seriously lack the attacking side of the game.

398~~~
He's meh

399~~~
Not really. In 61 games he must have played about two or three times there. He played regularly in that position at Spartak.

400~~~
He's just a bit of a headless chicken. His touch is abysmal as well.

401~~~
Man of the match for me today.

402~~~
Erratic but put in a solid shift nonetheless. He's getting there and that's a positive.

403~~~
Nonsense, for me. I think his all round touch and control under pressure out on the left borders on excellent. He's ultimately a centre half playing out wide, he's bound to put in the odd iffy cross.

On the whole he was very good tonight. We don't score without his good work.

404~~~
Thought he was very good to be honest, crosses were a bit inconsistent but he showed great fight and desire today. And bloody hell that rabona attempt <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

405~~~
Really liked his performance again today.

406~~~
An other good performance from him, I saw him play left back before 2014 and thought that he was a bit shit but he is improving a lot.

407~~~
Sums it up for me, working steadily at his performances at LB.

408~~~
He's pleasantly surprised me with his recent performances - looks very good both defensively and going forward. 

Mind you, I thought he looked decent for Argentina in the World Cup and that was at Left Wing Back so maybe that's his forte rather than CB.

409~~~
Hugged a fan by the neck while celebrating Rooney's goal. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

410~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/l2mq" width="560"></iframe>

Deserves some credit for the goal, love that desire. (Replay)

411~~~
that was some positive tackle.. 

Rojo's been solid so far.. he wouldnt be my first choice but if he can stay in this sort of form, play him there, his passion is great s well. hes one of those playing for the club, giving their 100%

412~~~
Has had a decent run of form at LB so far, just needs to be a wee bit more positive in terms of his overlapping runs, but his crossing has fairly promising so far (not today though). Defensively he has been pretty good except for that period in the 2nd half against Bolasie, who tbf, can be an extremely tricky customer on his day.

413~~~
Reminded me a bit of a Vidic tackle that was followed by a Silvestre cross and a Rooney volleyed goal (pint to whoever remembers the game I'm thinking of!)

414~~~
Arsenal few* years back, we won 2-0 I think.

That's probably 2006 or 2007.

415~~~

416~~~
I actually think he's actually very good. I think a lot of people decided he was shite either before he came and then got injured or stuff like the passport nonsense. He looks clumsy at times but he must be very difficult to play against.

417~~~
If there was actually movement in the box Rojo could have got a bunch of assists...Pretty sound game from him.

418~~~
Pretty good today again, shame he missed two good chances, would probably have got more MOTM nominations if it weren't for that.

419~~~
Done well to bomb forward today when he could and was solid at the back.

Also worked hard winning the ball back in the lead up to the goal.

420~~~
The best performance from centre back playing as full back I've seen in a while. It seems quite unnatural to him to play so attacking role though. 
Not sure if it wouldn't be better to switch him with Blind.

421~~~
I'm hoping he can do a job for us similar to what Ivanovic did for Chelsea (ignoring this season). Ie: not the most natural going forward but being a presence in the opposition box, defensively making us look more solid being naturally a centre half, and better in the air than the average fullback. He's done well the last few weeks.

422~~~
It'd just be lovely if he never did that fecking rabona again. It's the shittest, most pointless 'trick' ever. 

Apart from that we can't have many complaints. He was pretty solid.

423~~~
I've not always been his biggest fan, but he's looked good recently. His positivity was hugely important to our play today. Lingard seemed to defer to him quite a lot in the first half and Rojo more than lived up to the responsibility. That's encouraging from a player who's not normally a left back by trade.

I actually think his crossing was very good, too. Even the best players only average about 25% with crosses, so it's harsh to criticise him for missing the target occasionally. What really impressed me was how early he was willing to put the ball in. It's so refreshing to have left footer on the left wing in the final third. He (and Young) gave us the width we've been lacking all season. It's no coincidence that making the pitch bigger led to a higher tempo of passing. Long may it continue.

424~~~
Very good again. He could become an important player for us. I love his passion and determination when he plays. It was an excellent dispossession that led to the goal.

425~~~
Best part, is that hes an old school defender, loves to get stick in, and usually has his opposition winger in his pocket, most times hes played

426~~~
He can be a good back up to Shaw once the later returns. We need to keep him and buy a centre half or two this summer.

427~~~
Definitely not. He's an aggressive full back and unless you've got Martial's quality or are Bolasie in-form you've got a pain of a game dealing with him. He's quick, strong in the air, is able to cross the ball and is constantly going up and down the pitch. He really what you want from a full back. He's basically a less polished Shaw. He's also quite good at dealing with 1v1, especially away from the usual crossing space.

Blind is really composed and has no problem passing first time with either foot. That's a huge quality for a CB in a system that looks to keep the ball at all times. In a game like this there's no room for Jones when Blind can play.

428~~~
Yep! Its why I used to laugh when people said he was clumsy. He is a very hard defender to beat.

429~~~
I think his performances lately means we are not getting hit badly in Shaw's absence. He is really filling in well and putting in some gutsy performances. Once Shaw is fully fit, it'll be good to have two good LBs at our disposal.

430~~~
Great performance from him - great tackle for the goal and it was generally a good game from him. Missed two chances - but was positive enough to be in those positions. Love his desire and I hope he continues playing like this - on his day, he can be exceptional (just ask De Bryune). My MOTM today - wasn't expecting others to feel the same but I'm a bit surprised at his low match rating.

431~~~
I'm warming to him. Probably the best crosser of a ball we've had at LB in years. When he gets it right anyway. Still a bit inconsistent.

432~~~
This.

IMO he has had more good games than bad for us, stretching back to when he was partnering McNair at CB without a word of English in his vocab.

Good squad player to have

433~~~
There are moments in which he really acts like a headless chicken. On the other Hand there are moments of brilliance. And this guy works his ass off for the Team.

Fantastic Player in my books.

434~~~
Tbh I do not really see the Need for a CB. Smalling is on his way to become one of the world`s leading CB. Blind does a fantastic Job most of the time. Shaw has to be our No 1 LB so Rojo can Play as left CB as well.
And we still got Jones who should be given more games as well.

We screened the market this summer but there was no Quality available for the right Price.

435~~~
I like him. The most frustrating thing about him is that he's often seemed unavailable for unknown reasons for significant spells. But I'm glad he's returned to the side when we need him.
Hopefully a good run of games in the side will help him work some consistency into his crossing. It’s a little erratic right now, but he clearly has a very good cross on him. Some of his deliveries have been superb.

436~~~
He was great yesterday. If he had just a smidgen more quality in his crossing, he'd be regarded as one of the top LBs in the league.

437~~~
Fair points,

Securing stones would do wonders, but the priority this summer needs ot be attacking/creative players. Wouldn't mind blowing the whole summer budget on a winger and a striker.

438~~~
I've always quite liked Rojo. He seems to be surrounded by negativity on here at times but if all of our squad put in the effort that he does every week we'd be a better team for it. The lad has an engine on him and a surprisingly good cross. The rabona passes can stop though.

439~~~
Absolutely. Our Overall Football is not bad but we Need more attacking power.

440~~~
Couldn't agree more.

441~~~
Actually I agree with both of these points.

He can shape a really good ball into the box and a number of times this season there is just nobody in there, it was frustrating as I felt at times he didn't want to put the ball into the box against CSKA or he delayed it - let's hope the understanding comes in time.

442~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Nov/Marcos-Rojo-to-profit-from-Luke-Shaw-absence.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...os-Rojo-to-profit-from-Luke-Shaw-absence.aspx</a>

Speaking of hard work on the training ground, Rojo also admits to focusing on his crossing and hopes to improve as the season goes on. “Yes, I have, because I always used to play more as a centre-half,” he said.

“When it was time to move over and play at full-back, I had to work at it, both for club and country. It’s something I continue to work on in training, so I can keep on improving. Crossing the ball well, getting to the byline and helping to finish off a move are all key things I need to do in my position.

Good lad Rojo.

443~~~
To be honest, he's never looked shit in his time with us. Genuinely have no idea why he attracted so much ire. I think people have preconceived notions about his character and apply it to their interpretations of his performances.

444~~~
Agree

445~~~
Well said. Passion is something that is never lacking in his game and he gives it all. Hoping he weans out his inconsistencies and improves his crossing. Quite a stable option at LB till Shaw returns.

446~~~
Will his seemingly publicized run-in with LVG (as reported in the media) and reports of LVG not happy with him will have the same effect on him the way it had on Smalling  after City red card? I think so! I think the initial disagreements that were reported in the media during transfer period might have inspired Rojo to put in some gutsy performances and come May he might become an important and invaluable member of the squad.

447~~~
I remember one very dodgy performance at the beginning of last season (probably his 2nd or 3rd game for us - perhaps against Leicester?) where nothing went right for him. Other than that, he's always looked good to me. Certainly a great, versatile player to have in the squad.

448~~~
Rojo has played himself into some form at LB bar the blip away to CKSA. He seems to be less rash and has improved his decision making on when to bomb on and when to hold his defensive position.

449~~~
He's been rather good since his return from injury hasn't he? If he stays injury free I can see him do very well in that left back position. He's actually a solid defender and delivers a quality cross at times, just needs to do it a bit more consistently. Once Shaw is back, he might have to change position though.

450~~~
I like his aggression and passion.

451~~~
Bar the silly yellow card it was another good performance, gave nothing away down his flank and supported the attack well.

452~~~
One of the best on the field today.

453~~~
I've never been down on Rojo, so this decent performance was normal to me. That cross he had in the 1st half was pure sex.

454~~~
Solid as a rock.

455~~~
He's done very well since Shaw's injury. Could well be the best/most consistent crosser of a football at the club too.

456~~~
He's in good form. His booking was laughable, too. Mason (Dean!) gave it because he gave a booking to Rondon only seconds earlier and felt he had to make amends.

He then allowed Yacob to get away scot free when he fouled Mata on a counter attack. Shite refereeing as per the Premier League.

457~~~
He's a tank.

458~~~
Blind is the best crosser. Rojo is not bad at all.

459~~~
I thought the yellow was a rubbish decision from Dean. It was barely a touch on Sessegnon. He skipped a much worse foul in the beginning, he skipped Yacob twice. Dean's card game was off today.

460~~~
Coming into his own. Never agreed with the notion that he's comple useless and has no place here. Has all the attributes to be a great defender and he's just 25. Younger than Smalling.

461~~~
He's quite a good passer, a good crosser and can strike a ball so he's certainly not one dimensional, but he is predictable. A big step down from Shaw for me but he's proven he's a very reliable backup and fully justifies his place in the squad. His concentration is far better now so I think he does have a chance of establishing himself as Smalling's long term partner.

462~~~
Think hes better suited to LB than CB tbh. I think long term, he will be a Shaw cover (or rotate with him which is not a bad thing)

463~~~
Was always in the pro Rojo corner and I'm glad he's providing the performance some of us knew he had in him.

Long may it last, he loves playing for us.

464~~~
I think he's always been solid for us but this is definitely his best run of form for the club. Very good defensively and looks a threat attacking at times, although there's still room for improvement there.

465~~~
Definitely softened the blow on the Luke loss. Really like him and I feel he's slowly improving his delivery.

466~~~
Good again, glad we got the lb position sorted after losing Shaw.

467~~~
Somebody please get some work in with him on his crossing, he could be immense.

468~~~
Strange, i thought it was one of his better assets

469~~~
He's hopeless

470~~~
His crossing isn't too bad. In one match (might have been against City?) he looked really good. Another solid match, definitely looking like good cover for Shaw.

471~~~
He's crossing is really good. But there is often no one in the box attacking it which says more about our forwards.

472~~~
Anytime he's playing, you can see he wants to be here. I love players like that.

473~~~
I really like him, he is a good player.

474~~~
I think this is why playing someone like young at LW instead of memphis doesn't make sense.  He isnt a forward and we dont play the cross in and head it type of football anymore.

475~~~
The crosses themselves are sharp but he needs improvement on finding a target.  He can be as good as Blind or maybe even better with some extra training.

476~~~
Missed the game so glad to hear he played well.

I just caught highlights and it looked like he totally lost the crosser for that Berahino chance. Should've been stopping that.

477~~~
I think van Gaal picked this out too, he can really fizz a cross or a pass. After Carrick, he's probably the best at doing it in the squad - really driving the ball quickly across the ground or even in the air.

478~~~
No fault of Rojo's, I think it's under instruction, but I do wish he'd overlap a bit more. Watching Bayern, their full backs overlap left, right and centre (and by centre, I mean never through the centre because that's not what overlapping is...). When a team has its back against the wall it's a really effective attacking strategy.

479~~~
Think he's been absolutely fantastic the past couple of games.

Solid in the tackle, put in some brilliant balls going forward and he always gives everything.

480~~~
Agreed. He has the appropriate balance of aggression and class.

481~~~
Clown.

482~~~
Liability.

483~~~
Wanker

484~~~
Certainly not United quality.

485~~~
Looks slightly soft when you consider what some refs will ignore but it's plain daft given the time left on the clock.

Need smarter defenders than that.

486~~~
He's back !

487~~~
I do not understand what he was thinking. The striker was going nowhere and to pull something off from their would have been difficult.

488~~~
Feel sorry for Smalling and De Gea. The mainstays in that cleansheet run. Had to be one of the other idiots to cost them.

489~~~
How fecking stupid do you have to be to go for a sliding tackle in that situation? Brainless would be a compliment.

490~~~
Sliding tackle?

491~~~
I don't think he's that bad, big overreaction on here (which is to be expected).

Poor from him though.

492~~~
Poor challenge but he's been good in recent weeks. We'll see how he will recover from this in the next few weeks.

493~~~
You certainly are.

494~~~
Lost count of how many times I've said he's rubbish

What in God's name was he at for the penalty?!

Also, a minute to go and he stands off, letting the Watford player turn and get a shot in, instead of closing him down.

495~~~
People will forget how good he's been lately and tear into him now for one mistake. Fickle bunch. Although it was an absolutely crazy challenge to make.

496~~~
He didn't have a bad game up until the penalty but he looked shaky at times.  He still seems to panic at moments and that's why he does some dumb things and throws rash challenges like that penalty today.  Hope he matures because he has the physical qualities to thrive in the PL.

497~~~
He's been one of our best players in recent weeks. Cut him some slack.

498~~~
Well, that was stupid.

499~~~
You don't know what a sliding tackle is, obviously.

500~~~
Some people don't have memory beyond half an hour.

501~~~
Much better in the centre than on the left hand side. Still not a big fan. Can't stand his shanks up the pitch.

502~~~
We just don't like you!

503~~~
Moment of madness.

504~~~
Arsehole.

505~~~
Clumsy..  And dumb. But a bit of overreaction here..

506~~~
A day to forget for Rojo, I think. 

Struggled with the wind.

507~~~
I feel the opposite, I prefer him at LB. He's still a bit too rash, which is more of a problem at CB than LB.

508~~~
It the aimless chipped passes up the line. They drive me nuts.

509~~~
I just think he's a bit rubbish... I think that when he has good games and also when he has crap games...  So I'm being fair in my negativity at least!

510~~~
He's the new Silvestre. Silvestre was a good player but incredibly frustrating because of the occasional brainfarts. Good squad player but sadly not good enough long-term as a first choice if he can't sort that out.

511~~~
What?

He is terrible in the centre, before this game he had very good run on the left back position.

512~~~
Probably fair. 

Thought he had a pretty good game up until the penalty, and then fecks it up with a moment of madness. 

Still, it didn't cost us in the end and hopefully he learns.

513~~~
That was idiotic foul, hard to disagree, people are going overboard though about 'not united quality' shit, take a look back 2-3 pages ago when we played City and how he absolutely took out KDB out of the game.

514~~~
Brainless to hack down a player with his back to goal when we were in a decent defensive shape. I can't imagine he was expecting to play today given the travelling he's done, so I doubt he was anywhere near 100% to give him a little benefit of the doubt. But he should have done better

He had a few decent moments, and he didn't shy away from getting clattered by Watford's absolute monsters up front when they went direct. He stood up to them well and made some good tackles.

He's been solid for us in recent weeks, especially in the derby, so it's a bit harsh to turn on him because of one moment. He was playing reasonably well until that point too. Players make mistakes. It doesn't mean they're not good players anymore. He'll probably get a bollocking for it, and learn from it.

515~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> some here...gold fish memory at finest.

516~~~
Very clumsy and rash on the penalty but he's played well at LB over the last 5 weeks or so and I imagine he'll be back there on Wednesday.

517~~~
Wow, the overreaction in here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He fecked up, it doesn't mean he's a wanker/liability and that United should sell him. He's been a quality Shaw replacement at LB.

518~~~
He's been really good recently, but when he came on today he wasn't great. Looked a bit panicked. I must say I prefer him at left back, though.

519~~~
We all complain about how Jones has a lack of intelligence too often, too rash and makes mistakes. Even he isnt stupid enough to do what Rojo did today. What an idiot

520~~~
I like the comparison with Silvestre, especially since I didnt mind him at LB but worried when he was CB. Same with Rojo. Really was braindead to give away that penalty like he did. Could have cost us the game, he owes our attack (especially Basti) some beer.

521~~~
Such a daft challenge.

522~~~
Never United quality a time bomb of a player.

523~~~
Had a poor game. Looked off the pace all match I thought. Has impressed me more as a LB.

524~~~
A poor game, but he's better as a LB than a CB. He's far too rash at CB, he can get away with it at LB with players like Smalling there to bail him out.

525~~~
Brain dead challenge. He's constantly an accident waiting to happen.

526~~~
People are over overreacting. He's a very good CB even if he's prone to making mistakes.

527~~~
He's been quite good lately to be fair, but yeah, ridiculous challenge. Hopefully it's a one-off, although it's a shame to see him relapsing into daft errors.

528~~~
He reminds me alot of Silvestre. He's got all the skills to succeed but lacks the brain. Hence why he's a disaster waiting to happen. In my opinion he's nothing more than Shaw's cover. We should add a CB and RB and the defense will be sorted

529~~~
Better Lb than CB.

530~~~
Mostly agree with what you're saying, but very good CB's just shouldn't be error prone. Despite his recent improvement, errors stop a good CB from being a top class one.

531~~~
The attacker was backing in to him as he was making the challenge which meant he was never going to get any of the ball. He didn't need to make it though, just staying tight and stopping a shot was all that was needed....

532~~~
He'd done well at LB in recent games, but that penalty was just typical Rojo. Getting too tight, making challenges that don't need to be made. Might work when you're a LB on the halfway line but not in your fecking penalty box in the 85th minute. No one with half a brain thinks to make a nick the ball there.

533~~~
How many errors have we seen Ramos/Koscielny/Hummels etc make over the past few years? It's the nature of the game when you play as a front foot CB.

534~~~
Bit of an overreaction. He's proved himself to be a useful player lately. He's just not good enough to be a United starter, that doesn't mean he's a completely useless player.

535~~~
It was a mistake..the player had his back to goal and wasn't threatening, but I'm sure he was trying to make sure he couldn't pass to a player in a better position. He's a great squad player and has played really well recently and generally had a good game. People like to get on his back on here.

536~~~
Imo soft peno

537~~~
You mean stupid peno? So rash and just downright brainless!

538~~~
Yeah, he's one of those players who'll usually do well, but then the moment he makes a mistake people will come crawling out to label him as shite and wish him sold.

539~~~
Never understood why some people have it out for Rojo, apparently he is error prone but don't remember too many howlers. In fact can't think of any. Made a mistake today but doesn't warrant the criticism he has had

540~~~
I agree. Stupid reaction from me. Just pissed because it was so damn stupid.

541~~~
I remember my reaction when Smalling got sent off against City last season, so I will only say, shit happens.

542~~~
Well, he had a reputation for rashness when he came and he's somewhat lived up to it. Done a lot of good things as well of course.

543~~~
Jeez some people have really bad memories, give the guy a break.

544~~~
There's a reason he wasn't considered ready to start today, be it fitness or travel etc. He got out of jail with our late winner but so did our attack who failed to create/convert however many chances.

545~~~
Would much rather see him at left back and Blind at centre back. But we seem to like switching them at will.

546~~~
Thought he had a decent game. Really poor decision to try and win the ball but I think he will learn from that, just glad that it hasn't cost us.

547~~~
Stupid challenge to give away the penalty, could've cost us the match.

548~~~
I don't understand it myself. People have this pre-conceived notion of him as a rash, brainless player who can't defend, when in truth, he has been mostly solid for us. I guess it's because he's tatted up, looks like a thug, and the rash reputation is coming from his days as a Sporting player. There are CBs who are worshipped on here, that make stupid mistakes time to time, but you won't see this kind of reaction.

549~~~
Pre-concieved ideas play a huge role on here...once people label a player as something, then they will ignore everything else except what confirms whatever bias that they have. 

He made a mistake, but he's had a very strong run of form recently, and the comments are over the top.

550~~~
He doesn't seem to have the most focused head on his shoulders, he is slow, makes rash challenges and needs to shed a few pounds..  typical United full back! lol

551~~~
I wonder if the overreacting posters here get fired from their jobs the first mistake they make, expelled from school which seems more reflective of the age goven the quality of posts and opinions.

552~~~
Silvestre, very good at LB especially his crossings. Had a good season with Rio at CB.

553~~~
I like him. he made a big feck up for the penalty but otherwise he was ok.

554~~~
Jones is still fighting injuries, but with Blind settled in there and Rojo as the back up we're not suffering from it really. Every time he plays he does well and just need to stay injury free and we also have a 25 year old Rojo who can certainly improve as well.

555~~~
In 9 seasons Silvestre played over 360 games for us. I'll be surprised if Rojo gets to that level.

556~~~
To be fair to Rojo he's been very good defensively this season. Rarely has he been beaten one on one or been found out of position. So far he's been impressive when he's played. But he <i>is</i> a rash and aggressive defender and he's always on the edge between dominant and careless. In the copa America he was foolishly rushing into tackles repeatedly. So either we play him at left back always where we can afford the odd foul, and/or he learns that in the box you have to be extra cautious. But he's done well this season despite the very poor mistake.

557~~~
He was a mistake waiting to happen in 350, Rojo is a superior player.

558~~~
This. 
1. Hes still young
2. He just came here for Sporting, needs time to adjust
3. He has had quite a few injuries and has not played that much
4. He was immense at LB for a couple of games (City and Wolfsbusrg?) and delivered genuine MOTM performances. 

Give the guy a break

559~~~
Last united defender to score twice against Liverpool in one game. He's a legend by default. Silvestre> Rojo

560~~~
I still feel more confident with Rojo than I ever did with Silvestre

561~~~
Rojo's career so far at United has been streaky.

562~~~
I'll back him for now.. this can happen , Jones had also made a stupid tackle once or twice at our box... Jonny Evans was also mistake prone but cut it off only to lose all confidence and become so injury prone. Rojo has bgiger potential however his best position would be LCB in 3-5-2 I guess, he's no more than cover on the left for Shaw and not better than Jones, let him fight for that spot with Jones and maybe McNair, also put Blind in the mix and see what happens if any of the three can raise their game like Smalling did then we are good, there is a good competition right now and we should not rush into any decisions like buying some other CB unless some world class CB is available in the market, I mean we could try to get hummels or maybe laporte or we can actually give a go to one of our golden generation Tuanzebe/williams/CBJ, TFM as of next year or the year after if things are steady but Jones/Rojo have still plenty of potential and don't wrte of McNair with Blind who I in fact see as a back up for numerous positions...

563~~~
As a few have said already. He is a defender who defends on the front foot and is a strong tackler. He will give away many more fouls as this is his style so I'm sure Saturday won't be the last time he gives away silly fouls.

I think he is a very good and extremely useful player considering his versatility - Can't decide whether I prefer him at left or centre back.

564~~~
I think it has to be left back and only cover for centre back.  To become a good centre half he'll have to cut that rashness out of his game.  Vidic had a similar tough image but he knew when to fly into a tackle and when to step off.  Rojo reminds me of Rafael, he tries to get his foot in as quick as possible.  When it comes off it looks great but it's prone to conceding fouls and cards.  You can afford that more from a RB/LB but it's too risky from a centre back.  Also he's recently been our best crosser of the ball which is an added bonus from playing him left back.  I'd have him as first choice there while Shaw is out.  Obviously assuming Shaw comes back ok then he's clearly our starting left back.

Rojo has the tools to be a good player but he has to learn to pick his rash moments wisely.

565~~~
Has he even played at CB this season? I don't think of him as one anymore. Definitely a LB, and a pretty decent one.

566~~~
The penalty was stupid, but still less stupid than Smalling's card against City last year.

567~~~
Van Gaal said he was jet lagged and shouldn't have played vs Watford - he was brought on for Herrera while we at the same time changed our shape and conceded the initiative in the match entirely because of it. I'm not going to blame him too much, although the tackle was daft.

He's been very solid for us this season albeit inconsistent on the ball.

568~~~
Put a couple of decent balls in but went walk about a couple of times defensively.

569~~~
Yeah, he seemed a bit unreliable at times, but actually manage to pose a decent threat on occasion at times as well.

570~~~
He seems to actually have concentration issues, which you hear as a criticism at footballers often but I think is generally bullshit. 

Consistently good crossing this season, so that's something. If Shaw comes back strong and we buy a starting LCB and Blind can backup both (along with McNair and Jones for the latter and options like Darmian, Young and from the U21s at LB), I think he'll move on, maybe summer of 2017 instead of this coming one.

571~~~

572~~~

573~~~
that's a big shame... hopefully he'll be back before long.

574~~~
Missed 4 weeks last time it happened.

575~~~
I think we'll be signing some fullback cover in Jan.  Shame for Rojo though, he never really seems to get going.

576~~~
Oh just feck off....

577~~~
That's really frustrating. He was doing a solid job as a LB replacement. Probably need to sign someone now.

578~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_Ebp8bRS76/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000">Rojo had a surgery.</span></a>
<a class="externalLink" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_Ebp8bRS76/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/p/_Ebp8bRS76/</a>

579~~~

580~~~
Getting sick of seeing United players needing surgery.

581~~~
3 fullbacks out with long term injuries. I know a lot of posters have been slating LVG for our lack of depth, but this is just massively bad luck

582~~~
He would be the first Argentinian who goes on to have a meaningful contribution to our history. Such bad luck with injury.

583~~~
Like I said, I don't buy the lack of depth excuse. Our injury situation is just ridiculous. I don't know of any team that can handle injuries to four full backs.

584~~~
In fairness Tevez made a massive contribution to our CL winning season.

585~~~
Shame on me. I forgot his nationality. Embarrassing.

586~~~
Haven't seen anyone complain about the fullbacks to be honest.

587~~~
He's a Judas so it's understandable.

588~~~
If we can drag ourselves through three weeks, we need to get in a left back as soon as the window opens in January.

589~~~
Probably needs a new thread.
Sporting have lost the case to Doyen at the CAS. 
They will have to pay doyen €17.5m. 
Bruno De Carvalho will be devastated. <a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a>

590~~~
Not really. Like our President said in the media comunication, this process has just started and we are obviously going to appeal. He kinda expected it tbf. The most important thing for us is that we got rid of Doyen´s influence in our club. And that´s a positive thing, we just have to look at what we achieved so far without them. Two cup wins, one Champions League qualification last year and this year we are just one point behind Porto in the league. We are clearly improving

591~~~
Appeal to who?

592~~~
Swiss federal courts and there have been plenty of TAS decisions overruled there.

593~~~
Our loyal Argie was at the Away end at Stoke!



+100000000000 Respect.

594~~~
Good to see. I don't care if he gives away a few stupid fouls, when you see someone like Jones trying to play football, it's crazy some fans rate him over Rojo.

595~~~
Jones was absolutely woeful wasnt he, regressed so bad, sad to see.

596~~~
that would mean that there was a time when he was good.....he was always a bit shit but we all hoped that he will learn and eventually get better.

597~~~
Thought he was good under SAF in 2012/2013 to be fair, the bulldozer role suited him. Has had good patches of form last season as well, he always had brainfarts but he looks stupid in everything he does now.

598~~~
Good man!

599~~~
To think he gets paid £££££££ by our club and goes to games yep respect...........

600~~~
Indeed...nice gesture sure, but let's not over-romanticise that kind of stuff.

601~~~
In fairness you would hope to be getting paid with our standard of football atm

602~~~
I like seeing shit like that, bollocks to whatever he gets paid, I don't remember hearing that argument when people were fawning over Fletcher and Young doing it.

603~~~
It's only a good thing. Why do people have to be so cynical?

He could have sat with the directors or whatever but chose to sit with the away fans, to experience the atmosphere first hand. Not many players do that.

604~~~
Its not just football forums though. Some people walk around like a bear with a sore tooth annoyed by anything and anyone around. Rather pathetic.

It's a nice gesture by him, and even through his struggles here, you can see he's trying to adapt and get the club. Seeing our history with some of his fellow countrymen, i quite welcome this.

605~~~
Sits with the away fans, lurks around the stadium on non-match days. Reminds me of Evra the way he fell in love with the club.


<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/U0vvHmq.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/U0vvHmq.png"/>

606~~~
I like him, He seems to genuinely enjoy playing for the club and is underrated by our fans for some reason, especially considering he has been better than Phil Jones who some still think is going to be a good defender (yeah right).

607~~~
Only difference was Evra was a cracking player!

608~~~
Same here. I get the impression he couldn't believe his luck when he signed for us, and I think he's a much better defender than people give him credit for.

609~~~
Agreed. If only he had more luck with injuries I am sure he would be starting regularly. I still think he could be a fantastic player for us.

610~~~
He's great. We could do with more players who genuinely seem to like it here.

611~~~
I just don't understand the stick Rojo gets here.  Better than Jones by some distance and can put in a fantastic cross when he goes forward.  The only complaint is that he's been prone to injury.

612~~~
I'm repeating what's already been said here, but I boggles my mind the amount of criticism this guy gets. First, like Evra, he seems genuinely happy to have joined United (a stark contrast to his fellow Argentine that joined us last year.) Second, when healthy, I think he's proven to be a very useful player, one who play multiple positions, has a good cross in him and plays with passion. I remember him having a howler at the beginning of his first season (I think it was his second game, but I can't remember the opposition,) and he gave away a stupid penalty recently, but those are the only blights on his C.V. that spring to mind (well I guess the passport thing wasn't the brightest, but that seemed a bit of a tempest in a teapot kind of thing.)

Fitness permitting, I think he'll prove to be a very valuable member of our squad.

613~~~
In fact, I daresay I could see him becoming one of my favourites. Vamos Marcos the Red!!

614~~~
Here here...that is if van Gaal doesn't ship him off before he leaves. He has all the right attributes and is an absolute beast on my FM save.

615~~~
When's he meant to be back? We'd be better off if we can go back to our original CB pair with him at LB covering Blind's defensive deficiencies.

616~~~
He was playing very well in the LB role before he got injured.

617~~~
Yeah I think he's under-rated on here. Can be very solid. Has his moments, but more often than not he is a rock at the back. Can whip a good one as well.

618~~~
He's no Smalling but agree now that he's better than Jones and should pair with Smalling when fit.

619~~~
I thought 3 months was the initial prognosis but his injury is upper body related, so he's probably already in good conditioning and he looks to be without any cast on his shoulder in those pictures so may be sooner than that.

620~~~
For the time being, I like him better at left back with Blind the middle.

621~~~
I preferred that as well, but Blind has been quite unreliable at CB recently, Smalling has suffered from that as well.

622~~~
Seems like a bad patch of form and hopefully it improves because he is usually highly consistent. That being said I like Rojo in situations where he can react instinctively and not have to make decisions, which is at left back and Blind's decision making is safer at center back.

623~~~
He was defending quite well at left back and we looked pretty solid but we weren't getting anywhere near enough attacking joy out of our fullbacks. He didn't really have any chemistry or link up with the winger infront of him and for every good cross in, there were 7-8 very poor ones.

624~~~
Much needed if true.

625~~~
Wow, that's great news if true. I could've sworn van Gaal said he'd be out until March time.

626~~~
But where is the real source here? Looks like bs to me.

627~~~
It's not, he posted this today on Instagram after he caught his wife taking Fellaini out after training.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/cjfajf3.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/cjfajf3.png"/>

628~~~
Players still go to training while injured they just do different types of training

629~~~
Yeah i imagine there's nothin stopping  Rojo doing light training with an injured shoulder but the length of time out will be getting it back up to strength (unfortunately currently speaking from experience).

630~~~
My first thought when I saw this was, yeeesh fella behind him, careful with that shoulder!!

631~~~
Various German sources linking him to Schalke. Thinkable? I've doubts considering your already rather thin squad.

632~~~
nope. Plus I like him as a defender. Competent cover for LB and CB.

633~~~
Evra was terrible when he first arrived...

634~~~
Both rojo and jones are average and they are better that mcmare. The former is more useful cause the latter is a crock.

635~~~
My main issue with Rojo is he can be very rash..but not half as rash as Jones so he wins easily for starting LCB.

636~~~
Didn't take him too long to settle and he basically usurped Hienze by the end of his first season with the club

637~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

638~~~
Completely forgot he existed <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

639~~~
when is he coming back? he actually looked at least decent whenever he played for us this season.

640~~~
He might have least added some fire and fight to the team tonight.

641~~~
him and Valencia seem to have myserious seemingly forever long lasting injuries. Probably see Shaw back first!

642~~~
BBC reporting he trained today with first team squad too.

643~~~
Valencia as well. Probably don't have enough 'match rhythm' yet though

644~~~
Yeah just seen a picture of him and Mata in training. Good to have him back.

645~~~
Yeah Van Gaal the crazy bastard and his "match rythum". After 3 months rest, he should be starting against Arsenal.

646~~~
If CBJ is still injured by the time we play Arsenal we really don't have a choice except to play Rojo

647~~~
I'm a big fan of Rojo. I think he adds a lot of bravery, intimidation and other psychological elements to the team when he's playing. He's still at a decent age and I'd expect him to become a top player for us over time.

648~~~
I like Rojo but he's a CB not a left back.

649~~~
Agree!  I think Rojo and Smalling are our best pair.

650~~~
Good to see him get 20 minutes under his belt, he looked lively down the left.

651~~~
Yeah I thought he did pretty well in the time he was given. Put in some good crosses and linked up well with Memphis.

It's so nice to have some defensive depth back.

652~~~
He managed to not give away a penalty, so gets a thumbs up from me.

653~~~
Don't get the Rojo hate. He's a quality player.  Better than most of what we have.  Gets forward with purpose like Evra used to.  Was good to see him playing again today.  Was just getting up to speed before his shoulder injury.

654~~~
Good to see him get some PT. Helps to reinforce our defensive options. Not a bad cameo, but thought some of his passing was a bit short and off the pace.

655~~~
Nice little cameo from him.

656~~~
Great to see he's good even after a long absense due to an injury. He played very well in those 20 minutes or so and it's nice to have a defender back.

657~~~
If we weren't down to bare bones at the back I think he would have played a reserve game first but glad he's back, just got to keep giving him more and more match time till he's fully match fit I guess. Surprised he didn't look rusty and he did alright.

658~~~
Hopefully LVG doesn't start him at LB now ahead of the Kids.

659~~~
Great to see him back.

660~~~
I thought he actually played really well when he came on. Riley had impressed me, but when Rojo came on I didn't feel like there was a drop off at all on that side. Looked good getting forward as well, real purpose in his drives and link up play. 

We're in desperate need of numbers at the back, too, so his return could be coming at a perfect time.

661~~~
Wish he hadn't been so injury prone since his arrival. Really think he has what it takes to push on and become a great defender. Good in the air, has pace, can pass and drive forward with the ball. A little rash sometimes but CBs need experience and a consistent run, which he's never had.

Him, Herrera and Schweinsteiger have more passion than the rest of our squad put together.

662~~~
Waaat?!  Why on earth not?!

663~~~
Very good shift put in, linked up well with Memphis!

664~~~
Nice to see him back. Do you prefer Rojo as CB or LB?

665~~~
Rojo is actually a very good defender, but he just hasn't gotten off the blocks at Old Trafford yet.  Hopefully, now he will.

666~~~
Centre back. Doesn't offer too much from LB, and when Shaw's back he won't get a look in there.

667~~~
Against Arsenal?

Of course you've got to start him ahead of Riley, they'd make mince meat out of him.

668~~~
I agree that he's primarily a centre back, and Shaw is way ahead of him when fit. Rojo is a good backup LB when needed. I prefer him there to Blind as he's got more pace and is a better dribbler. He's got a great cross on him too. Positionally he can be a bit all over the place, but that goes for both positions. Still, very good squad player to have. He just needs to stay fit.

669~~~
Got to start vs Arsenal this weekend. Riley done nothing wrong but I wouldn't fancy him against the calibre of players that Arsenal have.

670~~~
How many penalties has he actually given away? Can't think of many from the top of my head.

671~~~
The one vs Watford

672~~~
I'm all for giving the kids a chance but surely in a game Like Sunday's you have to go with a world cup finalist over a kid who has played 1 senior game(?) against, let's face it, pretty poor opposition.

673~~~
I'm not sure if I'd prefer him at centre-half on Sunday with Blind at left-back instead. Blind is slower admittedly, but technically far superior and perhaps more likely to contribute when he does get forward.

674~~~
He only played 20 minutes last night. I can't see him starting on Sunday.

675~~~
I'd say a back four of Shaw, Rojo, Smalling and Darmian will be excellent, potentially one of the best. However, we just need to keep them all bloody fit, or buy good back ups.

676~~~
True. It could be great. The only injury-prone concern out of that lot is Rojo IMO. Even before the dislocated shoulder, his injuries seemed plentiful and long. Seems to be a constant in his career. He's 25 and has only made 160 club appearances in all comps.

Smalling's injury history seems to be behind him thankfully, Shaw's injury was a freak one, and Darmian's injuries have been heavy impact ones. He's been bulldozed into numerous times this season. I wouldn't be surprised if he's sick of English football by now, with the clatterings he's been on the end of. Bizarrely, not one of them was even given as a foul.

677~~~
He actually only missed 4 matches through injury at Sporting. Its his 10 games of suspensions, the shorter season in Portugal, and not being rated at Spartak so he was benched that have given him the lower amount of appearances rather than injuries.

678~~~
Rojo is much better at left back than he is a centre back. His reading of the game isn't good enough for a centre back.

679~~~
I already love the mad fecker. One of few players with drive and personality in the side. Glad to see him back.

680~~~
Not sure if I'd prefer to play Blind LB.

681~~~
Blind CB Rojo LB against Arsenal.

682~~~
In my opinion, Rojo is better at LB. He doesn't have the pace of Shaw but he has other attributes. Also he has a powerful shot that he could try more in that position and it's a tough defender. 
Blind is better as CB because he has a better ball control to start a play and his positioning is better.

683~~~
Think Rojo might have the second best delivery in the team.

684~~~
Its extremely erratic but he is capable. CBJ, Blind and Herrera i consider to have better deliveries. The list of those that cant cross is too long

685~~~
Yeah, seeing CBJ come into the team as a 19 year old and put in dangerous cross after dangerous cross is great and all, but it then makes you think how frequently the senior players feck it up in that regard.

686~~~
Absolutely. I'm fed up of rubbish delivery from the likes of Valencia, Darmian and Lingard this season, professional footballers that you'd think can work on this every day in training to see them land more crosses in the fecking crowd than the penalty area. Rojo also needs to improve the consistency of his delivery which i think he alluded to himself in an interview 3-4 months ago.

687~~~
Time for for him to bugger off 

Definition of average and always injured

688~~~
Made of glass.

689~~~
I'm not Rojo's biggest fan, but I thought he was good up until injury. Gave us some bite and aggression to balance things up with Blind and Carrick.

690~~~
Hope it's not serious. He wasn't even supposed to start today.

691~~~
Started quite well but injured again, him and Jones get the same type of injuries due to how rash they are in 50/50's IMO.

692~~~
Far from being a player that should be starting for Man Utd.

At most he's like Sylvestre. Totally pointless and disposable.

693~~~
Thought he was good tbh.

Van Gaal said he wasn't going to start initially. Hope it's not serious.

694~~~
Don't understand why defenders wear these thin flimsy boots. They offer no protection no wonder they get lots of bad knocks. 

He did well though, kept Walcott very quiet.

695~~~
Sylvestre was a much better player than Rojo.

696~~~
Can't fault Rojo for this injury. Welbeck really whacked him hard. I feared it might it have even shattered his ankle, such was the force. He looked decent on his return in ages, though should have done better for the Welbeck goal.

697~~~
I take you didn't follow the first years of his time with us. Silvestre was a very good player between 2001-2005. As left back at first, and then fantastic with Rio.

698~~~
Though he played well today. Not sure what this hate after today's game is about.

699~~~
I'd keep him. His injuries have sort of been unavoidable. The dislocation of the shoulder and the tackle today. Not really his fault. Plus, he's a good defender.

700~~~
Have people forgotten him bailing out the centre backs a couple of times in the first half? he was very sloppy in possession but did some crucial things defensively. Poor for the first goal but Schneiderlin was more at fault. Shame that he's injured again already.

701~~~
According to LvG's post match presser he was planning to take him off at the 60 minute mark and just did it early after he took that kick, he's not injured.

702~~~
Jury's still out on Rojo.  He's not going to light the league on fire like Evra or Shaw.  But he is a pretty good option as backup/role player in the defense.  He was not bad yesterday and glad to hear he was taken off as a percaution only.  He has that nasty streak and can bully wingers with his physicality.

703~~~
I think he's fully bought into the club and that coupled with his fiery personality adds something a bit different to our squad, he's a character. I don't see him being a regular starter here but given the way we pick up injuries he should still get plenty of games and is fine as cover in 2 positions IMO.

704~~~
I dont understand the hatred he gets. He always works his ass off, and its not like hes getting skinned every time the opponent gets the ball. He solid, just needs to get right health wise and get a run of games.

705~~~
I think one or two rash decisions he's made have given him a bad reputation eg. the challenge for the Watford penalty and the rush of blood challenge against City away last year where he ended up injuring himself.

On the whole though, I agree, he's a very solid defender who doesn't have any notable weaknesses. He needs a run of games and can be a very solid part of the defence. He's definitely our second best CB after Smalling.

706~~~
Thought he looked real solid up until his injury, and does add that bit of aggression that we sometimes lack.

707~~~
Yeah I can't remember what season but he was a real brilliant attacking thread in one season. RVN loved him. I'd say attacking wise he was better than Evra.

708~~~
Like him but like Blind and Jones, don't know what is his best position, he's neither a CB or FB....

709~~~
Indeed. Silvestre was very good for us. And he was always up for a fight <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

It couldn't have been easy playing with, at the time, a very casual and at times lazy, Rio. A very slow Blanc and of course Wes was always prone to a mistake or two. Silvestre takes a lot of the flack

710~~~
I think Rojo has been very impressive in general for us, obviously, apart from the time that he has been injured.

711~~~
Rojo is actually a pretty good defender, who backs himself with the ball at his feet - Smalling could learn a thing or two from him.

712~~~
Indeed, he was absolutely brilliant partnering Rio for the first half of the 03-04 season. It sounds bloody inconceivable and stupid now, but up until January he was pushing Henry as the best player in the premiership that season. Of course, then Rio got that 8 month ban and Silvestre completely and utterly fell apart.

I'll always remember Newcastle launching a counter attack from the halfway line with three attackers and only Silvestre being between them and the goal. He proceeded to slide tackle the first and the ball ran to the second, he picked himself up and came in to tackle the second but the ball ran to the third, and then he got over and slid into him as well to put the ball out. Tackled all three of them.

It was a shame he was only able to be at that incredible form level for a few months, but he also had other good periods.

713~~~
<i>It sounds like <b>Marcos Rojo</b> could start against Watford, despite coming off during Sunday's win over Arsenal. The boss explained in his MUTV interview: "It was a kick. A lot of players receive kicks and they can play the next match."</i>

714~~~
Played like he had itching powder in his arse crack.

715~~~
Bar one or two nice(ish) crosses, I thought he was complete garbage.

I think it was only due to Blind having the worst game possible that his crap performance went unnoticed. Feck knows why he felt he had to do everything at snail speed.

716~~~
He was terrible. I think he even headed Watford through on goal at one point?

717~~~
Understandable to see him back in the line-up straight away but long-term wise we have young options that can offer more than him in the LB role.

718~~~
Worst LVG signing. How the feck is he playing for United?

719~~~
Solid so far.

720~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

721~~~
Absolutely horrible.

722~~~
A pointless footballer

723~~~
Blind left Rondon free.

724~~~
Rojo stands and watches him.

725~~~
Blind had no interest in marking Rondon, I don't know what he's doing this game he has been very erratic. Think it's harsh to blame Rojo.

726~~~
He went to try and cover space. It was a mistake but he tried something. Rojo can see all that happening and Rondon in front of him and just stands and watches.

727~~~
He's quite possibly the worst defender I've seen at the club.

728~~~
Dont really need him. Sell him in the summer. Shaw and CBJ are the future.

729~~~
If Rojo was right sided he'd struggle to get a game in the premiership

730~~~
Never rated him. Just an annoying player.

731~~~
i really don't understand how a player, who is a centre back by trade be so useless defensively.

732~~~
Does he realise smashing it 30 yards up the pitch every time when martial is 3v1 doesn't work ? You would think after doing it 20 times the penny would have dropped. 

His crosses today were ridiculous too, floating them 30 yards in the air instead of drilling them low.

733~~~
What? Since when has "space" scored a goal?!

That goal is completely on Blind.

Having said that Rojo was/is crap.

734~~~
Well I actually didn't think he was as bad as many others today, still crap but at least he looks arsed.

735~~~
I'm only saying what happened. I also said it was a mistake. He anticipated the ball going somewhere and it didn't. Rojo seen all this and decided he'd just stand and watch it.

736~~~
Went to cover what space? Blind left his man again, did the same against chelsea

737~~~
He moved to the six yard box presumably thinking that's where the cross was going. How many times do I have to say the same thing?

738~~~
Same. He did as well as can be expected considering he isn't really a LB. Blind had a shocker today.

739~~~
I said this in a long post a while back... but you can do this a lot more often when you're a midfielder than when you're a CB... But then, Daley Blind is a midfielder.

740~~~
It's the definition for insanity, its a process, its LVG philosophy.

741~~~
For what? To hide behind Smalling, he's at fault for the goal not Rojo

742~~~
Exactly. The position isn't that natural to him. When it works it looks great but it's too dangerous. It was poor defending but he was at least trying. Rojo stands and watches it.

743~~~
I've said more than once it was a mistake. It was poor defending. I'm talking about Rojo watching it happen and doing feck all.

744~~~
Funny player. Can anyone explain to me what he is? like what does he do? what are his attributes? why was he signed?

Posted in here a few weeks back that I forgot he existed and today reminded me why.

745~~~
Yeah I've had this for a while now... what is Rojo actually really good at? Like, what skills / facets of his game does he excel in?

746~~~
Such a mid table player.

747~~~
He's pointless. Never understood why we signed him in the first place.

748~~~
not even

749~~~
I'm not really a fan but I think he'd do okay on the left of a 3 man backline where his physical qualities would be useful. Couldn't be a team playing for Guardiola-y possession, though. Not sure who fits that bill.

As for us, we should probably sell him - assuming Shaw will be back good as now - since Blind and CBJ are also around and basically as good at LB, and I think we could get a decent fee for Rojo just by virtue of him being well known, 25, versatile and a starter for the Argies.

I really don't trust him at CB. I think we suddenly look really disorganized when Jones or Rojo are in there. Smalling, Blind, summer signing and Fosu-Mensah is perfectly cromulent foursome, though with our injury record we probably need to keep one of Jones or Rojo around to have 5 guys to cover those 2 spots.

750~~~
Signed due to him being left-footed.

751~~~
Just not very good

752~~~
Unbelievable but true

753~~~
Was it £16m plus a year of Nani's wages (something like £6m)? Wow.

Anyway, he's being played out of position basically because Blind is too slow to get up and down the left. Until he gets a run of games at centre back it's hard to judge him properly but I'm not seeing anything that makes me think he'd be pulling up trees.

754~~~
Just another bad decision in a long line.

755~~~
There is no way he'd be here if not for LVG wanting to implement the 3-5-2 at the start of 14/15, him being the left footed centre back.

756~~~
Hes quick, strong, a good tackler and a good passer. Hes not world class but he is good in all the fundamentals of being a defender. His weakness is his penchant for a brainfart, but when youre competing for a position against Phil Jones you're always winning that one.

757~~~
Booting the ball to the other team.

758~~~
I wouldnt' say he's that quick... he's certainly nowhere near as fast as Smalling for a start. He's not even that strong... he's strong for his build (as he's fairly slight) but again, he's not as strong as Jones or Smalling or anything. 

Sometimes he's decent(ish) at tackling... but then other times he's rash and lunges in/makes daft fouls... so I wouldn't say thats one of his stronger facets... and if he wasn't prome to aimless long balls, I'd say he was a decent passer.

759~~~
He's rash, very error prone, inept with his positioning and when he isn't hoofing balls up he's playing risky passes trough the middle (Which often get cut off) for no apparent reason. He seems a nice guy and all that but he's a bit shite at football on the evidence so far.

760~~~
Not too sure why we bought this guy. He really isn't very good at all.

761~~~
the only reason we bought him is because he is left footed

762~~~
LvG innit.

763~~~
Said it last season, worse defender I have seen play for this club. Has no redeeming qualities. Argentinian Buttner who cost 5 times more.

764~~~
Thought he was our worst player tonight. Consistently awful on the ball. Add him to the 'dead wood' list.

765~~~
Rubbish

766~~~
Dreadful again, though I'll give him the caviat that today that the tactics really didn't help him at all... he looked like he didn't have a clue what he was meant to be doing or where he was meant to be half the time.

Also, his passing is shocking.

767~~~
No brain.

768~~~
He's got the heart but not the ability.

769~~~
Yeah, still not sure what he does and what he's supposed to be doing, does he even know? Does LVG know?

770~~~
Thought this thread would be more active. He really isn't a Manchester United player, he's so average and even then, he makes far too many mistakes. Don't under what LvG sees in him at all.

771~~~
Can't believe we essentially replaced Evans with this guy.

772~~~
Replaced with Evans with Evans....Why not?!

We replaced Fergie with Moyes. Anything is possible

773~~~
He should be 4th choice LB at most.

774~~~
The russians knew this years ago. I am sure they are shocked at his price and knowing the russians, they must suspect some massive kick-backs in this deal.

775~~~
Absolutely baffled at how shite this guy is. To think we gave Sporting 16m and Nani on a free for this clown

776~~~
Anyone notice how worst we've played since he's been back?  He can't defend and gets caught ball watching a lot.  I want Mensah in the team against West Ham

777~~~
I like him, but the difference between his top level and his bottom level is so stark that you really can't plan around him. He's just as likely to neutralise a teams most dangerous player out of the game, as he is to run at him from 70 yards and dislocate his shoulder rugby tackling him.

I also think he's a much, much better centre-half than he is a left back. I think at his best he's good enough, and I'd probably give a new manager the benefit of the doubt if they thought they could get it out of him consistently, but he's another one that can have no complaints if he's sold in the summer.

778~~~
He's had two seasons now, and he still looks as rash and incompetent at the dealing with high balls as when he joined. I'd happily bin him at this point.

779~~~
It makes me laugh that he was LVG's personal signing. All the talk of Van Gaal's philosophy and the tactical sophistication of the game we would employ and he signs a player of base football intelligence.

780~~~
I still quite like him. I believe he's capable of better than what we have seen from him this season, but that goes the majority of the squad, if not all of it. The one thing really holding him back is the long, long, mysterious injuries. He's just rarely ever available. I sort of forgot he was even a United player until he was in the away end at Anfield a few weeks back. He had a very long spell out last season too, coincidentally, both injuries spanned over the winter months.

Him starting at left back vs Liverpool but then moving to a back three (where we bring him in to centre back and move Blind out wide) seemed a weird and overly complicated move to make mid-game. Why not just push Rojo forward and let him put the ball in the box? He's a good crosser of the ball and is a bit more mobile than Blind. Making too many defensive changes mid-game has been a constant this season, and it always appears to be a little damaging.

I hadn't noticed that. In the 9 league games he has played, we have only lost once. In the 13 games he missed, we only won 3, and lost 5. I'm not saying he is remotely responsible for the form, but our form is actually better when he plays.

Same happened last season, he got a good run of games and he was very good. We only lost 1 of 11 consecutive games he played. Then he got injured and we lost 3 on the bounce. Coincidence? Perhaps, but he's the least of our worries IMO. Good squad player as far as I'm concerned.

781~~~
In those 9 games, we've conceded a mere 6 goals and kept 5 clean sheets (Won 6; Drawn 2 and Lost 1).
In the 20 he hasn't played, we've conceded 21 goals and kept 8 clean sheets (Won 7; Drawn 5 and Lost 8).

782~~~
Is he really that shit as people say he is?

783~~~
No, he is a good player with good potential.

784~~~
Makes me nervous like Jones, so erratic.

785~~~
Shitier.

786~~~
Can't wait until Borthwick is back.

787~~~
Apart from his shooting I think he was one of the better players. I agree that he constantly makes me nervous, but at least he looks half decent going forward.

788~~~
He offered some urgency in the second half but some of his final decisions are off.

789~~~
I like him. Always gives his all, doesn't pussy out of challenges, is pretty decent on the ball as well, along with being pretty reliable when fit either out at left back or center back. He's not going to be a starter because Shaw is brilliant when fit, but he's a very good squad option to have.

790~~~
I never realized how fecking slow he is, Carrick was running past him. The only good thing he really offers is his driving runs but even then when he gets into the good position he does feck all with it. He plays aimless long balls all game, is good for a 40 yard shot into the upper tier, and thinks he has the ball skills of Iniesta despite being distinctly average for a defender on the ball. He'd be a lot better if he didn't play like a complete idiot.

791~~~
Had a hot and cold game day today. Did a lot of good, but made some bizarre decisions on and off the ball.

792~~~
I wish the days of playing centre back as full back are over. He has no idea how to attack in this position, and makes some really weird decisions. What is even more strange is how much of a ball he sees.

793~~~
He honks get rid asap!

794~~~
I actually would prefer him next to smalling as LCB. But hes been moved around so much (another player we do that with).

I swear he started there and then it changed after 5 minutes. Was odd.

795~~~
Yeah that was weird... I was pretty happy to finally see Rojo playing his preferred position (even if I do think he's a bit crap), and Blind playing where he's more comfortable... but yeah, he changed it after 5 minutes. It's like LVG was  intentionally trying to feck with me or something.

796~~~
Hes been on a mission all season!

797~~~
Dogshit player.

798~~~
If only he scored that.

799~~~
Dogshit post.

800~~~
But he has s point Rojo is fecking rubbish

801~~~
Not even a PL player.

802~~~
Honking

803~~~
I like him, he's just not very good.

804~~~
He's yet another player we have in our squad with very little technical merit. We have too many who can't pass or control the ball properly, and they need to go.

805~~~
Who is worse: Him or Blackett?

806~~~
Today he added not really giving a shit to his already high level of crappery.

807~~~
This guy was strolling around towards the end of the first half as if he were the playmaker.

808~~~
I'm really not sure about the bloke in terms of quality but do feel the need to defend him a <span style="text-decoration: underline">little</span> regarding his effort.

For the first 30 or so minutes he was charging around, getting up and down the pitch like nobodies business. They showed him on close up a few times and you could see the sweat and how much he was panting from his exertions (not that this proves anything in itself but it turned out to be an ominous warning). He is either not up to match fitness yet or/and not the fittest player in the world and thus unsuitable for the FB position (arguably the most physically demanding role in the team in terms of stamina, length of sprints and short recovery times).

He burnt himself out and probably should have been subbed at half time IMO and appears to carry a bit too much muscle mass to ever be a modern FB.

809~~~
I laughed like an idiot when some guy on Twitter suggest that he's still better than CBJ and Riley.No sorry he isn't.Not a LB for me.

810~~~
Smalling - Blind as CBs have been decent. However, I think Blind needs to rest, so Rojo could play as defender instead of left back.

811~~~
Hes not a LB.

812~~~
Said it in 2014 when we signed him and got butchered.


He is awful!!

813~~~
I still think this is one of the main problems with him. If he just played properly he could be a half decent backup player but instead he thinks he is fecking Iniesta.

814~~~
Want to praise Rojo for one thing. He's often got a MC open to his side but he usually finds the forward instead. He doesn't want to pass it backwards/sideways.

815~~~
Rojo is a <i>terrible</i> passer.

816~~~
Why does he get taken off 60 minutes into each game ?

817~~~
Not fit enough to play the full 90 apparently.

Thought he was crap again today.

818~~~
I like his passing at times, tries to be positive and found his man a lot of times in the 2nd half. But still overall our worst player on the pitch, needs to get tighter defensively.

819~~~
Starting to dislike him. Controls the ball with one touch and then loses the ball with some silly pass. Always seems to get beaten one on one as well. Aerially he's alright but he's the weak link in our defence at the moment

820~~~
Very poor today. Gave the ball away cheaply, never looked like stopping Navas, and got beaten easily by Demichelis in the air from a free-kick; fortunately it went wide.

821~~~
His stamina is quite poor, he looks gassed so early in matches.

822~~~
Him and Darmian do not convince me at fullback, they leave too much for our 2 CB's to do IMO.

823~~~
He is a terrible player at this level. Totally slack and unfit to boot.

824~~~
well if we want to play him then try him as CB, if he's shit sell him, we already know he's terrible left back

825~~~
I've defended him a lot in the past, but he's been an absolute liability lately. 

Sort it out, Rocko.

826~~~
The last 2 times its cos he's been our worst player on the pitch

827~~~
He's been sick for the past couple of weeks

828~~~
Can't believe he cost £16m. Careless in possession, weak, offers nothing at all going forward,  got skinned by Jesus Navas who's a one trick pony. Really can't see him staying beyond the summer. He's wank.

829~~~
"I miss the club, my family and my friends," <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.tycsports.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rojo told TyCSports</a>.
"I want to return to Estudiantes once I finish my contract in England." (2019)

830~~~
Can we ship him this summer?

831~~~
He's not very good, but he's still got time to improve if he calms down. He's younger than Smalling, but I wouldn't say he's shown much promise. He reminds me of Silvestre, who we persevered with for years, despite being a terrible player. It didn't stop him winning 5 league titles.

832~~~
Leave Marcos alone!

833~~~
Honestly can't see that he's such a poor player. For me he's more than good enough to be an option at both CB and LB.

834~~~
Silvestre was much better. He had good games to go with the awful ones at least. Rojo's best performances almost reach average.

835~~~
People cant believe that he cost 16mil. pound...<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> in market where Mangala costs 42mil. and some other examples.

836~~~
It was more like £23m because they got Nani free for a year. Nani was their best player when he was there!

839~~~
Get off Rojo's back...he certainly ain't the worst player we have.  Stupid how people are prepared to put up with the crap we have like Schneiderlin yet always on Rojo's case.

840~~~
This frustrates the hell out of me...

You have got the opportunity to play for one of the biggest football clubs in the world and not being 100% dedicated to your career... 

If I had the chance to become a pro footballer, I'd take it, (work my arse off and be 1000% dedicated) hold onto it and never let it go. Never mind playing for Manchester United.

Yet he smokes.. Wasting his opportunities, only way is down for him imo.

841~~~
Mad about this. Get out of our club, Rojo.

842~~~
Rojo is simply not good and reliable enough. Schneiderlin has proven himself in England, he's far from crap.

843~~~
You had the same chance a him, a better chance even. You just didn't work hard enough as a kid or a teenager. That is unless you've got some sort of condition that prevents you from having done so.

844~~~
There's a difference between having a cigarette and being a 'smoker.'

845~~~
Rojo on Instagram:

 “...for those with no life, a big hug and see if you stop making things up that are not and try to be happy."

846~~~
It's not exactly making things up if he's been caught on camera doing it.

847~~~
Smoke and ruin a perfect family in one night. Wow

848~~~
If he is a smoker then that is dumb but if he smoked a cigarette socially then who cares. Cantona and Zidane both smoked cigarettes.

849~~~
hopefully he gets Vangalled on return

850~~~
What? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> dont be silly, he already shagged that fitness girl in Manchester, thats what she claimed. Anyway, dont make up rumours

851~~~
Schneiderlin is like Platini compared to Rojo. He is quite simply an average player.

852~~~
I stand by my first impression. He's like a shit Mickey silvestre

853~~~
Don't think he hurts the team when he plays, but what does he add really? At least Young, Fellaini, and Valencia have had some important moments of quality during their time here. Can't say the same for Rojo.

854~~~
Hardly a fair comparison, Fellainis in his third season, Young's been here for what, 4 or 5 years? Valencia even longer than that. Rojo's only in his second season here and has been injured for a good chunk of both of them.

855~~~
I'm slightly less concerned by the fact he's a smoker than the fact he's absolutely fecking pony.

856~~~
I just don't get the hoo-haa behind him being caught smoking once. Its a social event, its not like he is a regular smoker!
And selling him because of this is way too senseless. He should be fined (I don't agree with this although!) depending on the rules the club has regarding this and whether it is permissible for players or not. But selling one of our fitter defenders when we lack them is bonkers. I actually would like to know whether they are thinking that we'll end up signing 2-3 CB's ready for 1st team that you wish him to be sold. He isn't a starter material but he is more than decent squad player

857~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

858~~~
Woah easy tiger, what's your problem? You have a soft spot for Rojo or something.
You know nothing about me or my chances or about my life as a kid. Even if I told you about my football career you wouldn't care, probably just say something else ridiculous like 'Unless you've got some sort of condition'...

859~~~
I don't know anything about you which is why I put in the disclaimer. I'm just saying that Rojo grew up in a poor neighborhood in Argentina and is now playing for Manchester United. What opportunities did he have that others didn't? I'd say that just by growing up in England your chances are bigger by default.

860~~~
Come on, in that time have you seen much to suggest he should have a long future here? Blind has shown more at CB *and* LB and I'd rather play the likes of CBJ over him as our backup LB. He's fine as a 3rd or 4th choice but I feel that's the role of the young players

861~~~
Yeah time to go, a nothing player hopefully we'll get rid

862~~~
<img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

863~~~
Zidane used to smoke, Ashley Cole smokes, Messi smoked at some point.

864~~~
He's had some highs with us aswell as some lows, but the ones you compared him with people have wanted out for much of if not the majority of their time with us. We shouldn't be hasty about throwing people out of the team right now, we need to build on what we have. Unless we bring in a top defender I wouldn't get rid of him. And even if we do there are no guarantees, Mangala was a big transfer and he's way worse and Otamendi hasn't been that great either. CBJ is doing well now but in a year he could be as much of a non entity as McNair is as of now, that's the thing about youth.

865~~~
Isn't it obvious that this isn't about the smoking? It's just people seeking a reason to bash a player they deem unworthy of wearing our jersey.

866~~~
OMG!! He smokes. Against our club's philosophy.

867~~~
I do agree on this, we can't just keep rebuilding and rebuilding. We've essentially done that for the last 2 seasons. Rojo isn't our biggest problem and didn't cost much. But we should definitely be looking to improve in his primary position. If we do, he becomes our 4th choice CB between Blind and Jones. I can't see him improving beyond that

868~~~
smoking isn't the reason to get rid , he's really not good enough

869~~~
I love blind but he should be our 2nd choice LCB. Rojo is not good enough to start above blind. 

However, I think he will be really good in another top league. Just the pace of this one makes him slower than he really is ( in the brain too)

870~~~
Yep agree Rojo needs sold but don't think he'd be great anywhere as he just looks average.

871~~~
Can we get rid of him? He's really average and dumb.

872~~~
Awful.

873~~~
Is there any winger in the Premier League that can't beat him at will?

874~~~
That volley just sums him up. Wtf is going through his head. I'm actually starting to hate him.

54% passing, worse than De Gea. Every decision he makes is just stupid.

875~~~
Put in a couple of very good crosses.

Nothing apart from that though. Delofeououoyou has had his number in that first half. Surprised they decided to switch him and Lennon when Rojo couldn't handle him.

876~~~
Simply not a good enough player.  Shocking how poor some of LVG's buys have been.

877~~~
He offers us no outlet on the left, he makes it 10 times easier for teams to sit back and absorb our rubbish attacks.

878~~~
Always looks like a centre back playing full back. Does his best but it's all a bit meh.

879~~~
the only thing he offers is a good cross here and there but his game is very one dimensional, I think he was very poor, doesnt have touch and dribbling good enough for other than CB, suspicious at CB, might be sold in summer or give him a run of games at CB and if he doesnt take it sell him, would rather play TFM as LB now

880~~~
He looks like a full back when he plays Centre Back. 

He's just shite. Nothing more to it.

881~~~
Honks the place out

882~~~
He's terrible. Thankfully he's off now.

883~~~
Nice one, hes been fecked off.

884~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Think you may be onto something.

885~~~
When was the last time he finished a full 90?

886~~~
Glad to see him booted.

887~~~
Memphis would struggle

888~~~
Hurry back CBJ.

889~~~
On the very end on the list of players I'd play as a fullback.

890~~~
I've backed him in the past but he looked like he'd rather be in Argentina (sound familiar?).  Absolutely dogshite performance.  Should be benched.

891~~~
Squad player at best, absolutely shit. Needs to get his head down and start to put in some work in the summer, instead of smoking and hitting on girls every week. Otherwise he will be gone faster than he can say Estudiantes.

892~~~
He's back, played for Englands U19 side.

893~~~
We need to stop signing players from Argentina. And that's not the Brazilian in me saying that.

894~~~
LVG needs to stop playing him, he keeps wasting a sub on him because he stinks the place up every game, then we end up finishing the game with a knackered Martial, Lingard and Rashford. Just don't bother with him, play Mensah or Varela or anyone.

895~~~
I can't believe Barcelona are being linked with him, although he'd probably do well there because he wouldn't have to do much.

896~~~
He isn't as bad as his performances are suggesting, he's come back from his injury woefully unfit. That in itself is a huge crime, he's a pro footballer, why hasn't he cycled or kept himself in shape. 

He looks like he's struggling to run to me.

897~~~
£12m I read too, bloody unbelievable.

I guess you don't have to be a good defender in the Barca back line.

898~~~
He's linked with Barca? Sell him I say, especially if we sign another starting class CB in the summer we'll have plenty of cover in Fusa, Blind & Jones.

899~~~
I thought at times last season he looked decent with Smalling at CB. But yeah, hes not a LB.

900~~~
I think he's been hugely defensively suspect, players like Navas and Deulofeu were having way too much joy against him.

901~~~
Not even Dybala?

902~~~
Nobody would say no to Dybala or Messi. Aguero would have been a success for us too. We just seem to always find either cnuts or just average ones.

903~~~
Ooh-er

904~~~
They signed Vermaelen another crock so there is hope! Rojo reminds me of Heinze limited player but Heinze at least showed commitment!

905~~~
3 expensive flops, plus 1 that went to City and 1 that wanted to go to Liverpool. Wow, with that record even Messi would've probably been shit for us

906~~~
Heinze was United player of the year at some point and generally a very good player (a cnut though)

907~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> harsh

908~~~
He would be a disaster at Barcelona. It is true he won't be as busy but they play a high line and get counter attacked all the time. So many times their defenders find themselves in a one on one situation.

909~~~
Yeah Heinze was actually very good.

910~~~
He's fecking gash lads.

Not too pro off the pitch either if I'm not mistaken?

Not here next year.

911~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

912~~~
Him at Barcelona <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

913~~~
Now he's drinking BEER.
<a class="externalLink" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BD6R-hpRSyL/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/p/BD6R-hpRSyL/</a>

Think of the children

914~~~
Been subbed something like 4 times in last 6 games very early. A real joke. And which other manager in history has wasted so many subs on full backs!
He's either fit for 90mins at least at the start of the game in theory, or he's not. If he's not, start someone else!

The disgrace with Rojo, is we had to pay a fairly high fee, AND give them Nani into the mixer. One of our all time worst transfer dealings in that combo I think.

915~~~
ps Barcelona! What is it with them buying sh!T defenders, or converting mids.

Why not go out and spark out buy two top quality ones!

916~~~
Must be his brother in that picture beside him right? Looks like Marcos in a couple years time the the way he's going.

917~~~
Can we get rid of this clown?

918~~~
He's really poor.

919~~~
This is what happens when you sign a player just because he's left footed. He's awful. And useless on the ball to go with his terrible defending.

920~~~
The sooner the better!

921~~~
Did he win a competition to become a footballer? He's absolute wank.

922~~~
Hopefully sold this summer

923~~~
Add foul throw to his long list of footballing crimes.

924~~~
Lol it's amazing how bad he actually is. Offers nothing.

925~~~
I'm convinced we only bought him because he's left footed

926~~~
Awful.

927~~~
Punchable face makes it worse

928~~~
Most of this forum could skin him.

929~~~
The problem is that even on his best days, he is just a reasonably solid defender.  and we dont get nearly enough of those days.

930~~~
How much did United pay for this dude?

931~~~
Get Darmian on ffs. Rojo should never play LB.

932~~~
Lucky not to have conceded a penalty as well.

933~~~
He's clearly not a left back. And arguably only good enough to be backup for us at CB. Can only blame LvG for persisting with him when Darmian is available. He seems to be the "safe choice" due to aerial ability and the fact he offers little going forward.

934~~~
He's obviously starting so LvG can fulfill his need to sub a fullback on in every game.

935~~~
He's absolutely fecking pony. That much has been clear for quite a while.

936~~~
Fixed.

937~~~
What happened to CBJ? Rojo has been shit for a few games now.

938~~~
Caught out again with a simple ball behind him. Useless.

939~~~
£16 million for this clown.

940~~~
So useless, he and Darmian are absolute shite.

941~~~
And again. Worst United defender ever.

942~~~
And Nani on loan. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
If I didn't laugh I would cry

943~~~
Carragher called his defending embarrassing. 

Can't disagree

944~~~
Wasn't one of the reasons we bought him to keep company Di Maria? Read at the time they became really close during WC <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

945~~~
We should stay away from Argentinians.

He cant defend, he cant cross, his passing is terrible, his positioning is terrible, and he even does foul throws. ...

946~~~
Maybe PSG will buy him in the summer to keep delicate Di Maria company in Paris, we'll pay the shipping fee as a show of good will.

947~~~
We got scammed

948~~~
Should never even be close to playing a game for us when Shaw is back.

At least Blackett was okay on the ball despite being a fecking liability. Rojo is a fraud.

949~~~
Are all Argentinian players amazingly thick or is it just the ones we sign? 

He'd probably be better at centreback, but he's so bafflingly insane at fullback you don't really want to risk finding out.

How come LVG didn't like Rafael but plays people at fullback who are basically what Rafael would be like if you took away everything useful about him?

950~~~
I am convinced LVG signed him mostly because of his left footedness.

His left foot right foot fetish first saw Blackett promoted undeservingly, then us going after Vermaelen strangely and then ending up with us signing Rojo on the fallback. (Also Blind CB is part of that.)

951~~~
Thought the same last night during the game.

Pretty much any of our fullbacks van Gaal insist on playing are worse defensively than Rafael. Incredible how idiotic decisions he makes, just incredible. Yet many here are still happy we got rid of Rafael, despite having fecking Rojo and Darmian starting every week for us. Rafael is probably even better on the left than Rojo is.

952~~~
This twit didn't even bother challenging Alderweild for the second goal. No freaking loss if he never plays another game for the club. We do have amazing luck with the Argentinians don't we?

953~~~
Back when we had Evra Ferdinand and Vidic, a conceded goal would feel so unusual that I would analyse it and see where we went wrong

Now it just feels expected and normal, I don't even actually know what Rojo did or didn't do. It's all a bit meh at the moment. It's so difficult to really care when it's obvious the players don't

954~~~
16 million, plus Nani on loan and we paid Nani's wages.....

Just think about that

955~~~
We have the second best defence in the league and our last two title seasons we let in 43 and 37 goals. We've only let in 30 now with 6 games to go so Evra, Ferdinand, and Vidic were letting in more goals than we currently are.

956~~~
The point is, we scored so many then that the conceded goals that the conceded goals seemed rare by comparison. Whereas now they are not

957~~~
Apples and Pears.

958~~~
I used to like Rojo. He was the only player who seemed to genuinely enjoy the Cambridge away game and its more physical challenge last year. In hindsight maybe he enjoyed it so much because he'd found his level. I can't believe I'd ever advocate picking Ashley Young at left back over an Argentine international, yet here we are.

959~~~
How about we let the boy mature and find his preferred place before shipping him away after he's only getting grips with the English game??   He's only 25y playing without a brake from the summers WC and thus having a season with multiple injuries..

960~~~
Sometimes you just look at a player and think not in a million years. He's so out of place I can't ever imagine him being good enough.

961~~~
I actually thought he was decent at CB last season. But he is terrible on the left. Slow, not a good passer and although is capable of a good cross - he's got maybe 2 in all season.

He also seems like he doesn't want to be here either. No disrespect, we should stay away from Argentinians except for Messi.

962~~~
He was. Last season he played fine at CB and badly at LB. I think almost every other manager in the league would swap him and Blind around.

963~~~
He is dreadful.

964~~~
The worst player I've seen in a United shirt

965~~~
Terrible player..
Offers nothing

966~~~
By far the worst player on the pitch, time and again he wasted good openings that Martial and Rashford worked him into. I can't see him making it past the summer.

967~~~
Awful tbh.

968~~~
feck me he's dreadful

969~~~
Don't think he picked a man out in the box all night. Hit the first defender every time. Looks awful atm

970~~~
I thought he was ok today. Much better than his previous two performances. Apart from the City home game, and the cross for Herrera's goal at Everton, it is hard to think of many games in which Rojo has looked decent at left-back. 

He is very lucky to be getting starts right now.

971~~~
Get rid.

972~~~
Probably my least favourite United player.

He never completes a game. Either gets subbed off because he is injured or subbed off because he is shit.

And considering LVG does not like players to play on instinct, that's all that Rojo actually does. And unfortunately he just happens to be instinctively shit.

973~~~
He's really poor, him and Darmian have been two massive disappointments this season.

974~~~
I feel sorry for whoever plays on the left side of the attack for us as he's so sloppy.

975~~~
#RojoIsShit is a more appropriate hashtag for his twitter posts.

976~~~
He's a terrible player.

977~~~
Needs to be a CB or not play at all.

978~~~
It feels like because he's not a high profile member of the team, he's sort of gotten away with having a fecking terrible season.

He's been woeful.

979~~~
I made up my mind not to judge the players too much this season given the poor instructions they are clearly been given however I'd be glad to see the back of this one. Never convinced me once that he can handle a player running at him.

980~~~
He did some good defensive things today, but as a full back, where he's expected to contribute in attack and defence, it's pretty much like playing with 10 men.

I still think he is a more than adequate defender, but I don't understand why he always starts at LB. Blind would offer a whole lot more there. Even Darmian or Young would too. TFM definitely would. What happened to Riley? He did well there. CBJ too. Bleedin' hell we've fielded a pissload of left backs this season.

981~~~
This. And even at CB im not so sure of him but at least there, he can just sit with Smalling and defend. Hes garbage as a LB. I really cant wait until Shaw is back.

982~~~
He's a defender and he did a rabona clearance at the World Cup in the box. And some pricks thought it was ok 

What else is there to talk about??! Clown

983~~~
Still did very well for the U21s every time he played but too down the pecking order to be considered for the first team now that almost everyone's back.

If it's based sorely on merit Rojo should be around 5th choice for the LB position.Almost every other players who are played at LB this season shown more than him.It's not just about form.He just doesn't have enough attributes especially offensive to play in this role.

I might be too harsh on him but I really hate those senior players who played ahead of the younger players just because of their seniority and/or because they were bought by the manager.Make no sense both short-term and long-term.

984~~~
I like him but he has been dreadful this season. Hopefully it is a blip, he isn't old and was good last season here. Seems like he's had some issues in general and he's been fecking piss bad as a left back.

985~~~
Is CBJ still injured? Else it makes no sense for him to not come straight back into the set up.

986~~~
He's been fit for 2-3 weeks.Due to his illness they are easing him in but really he should have come back into the picture by now.

987~~~
Correctomundo.  LVG's need for a CB that can pass with his left foot means Rojo gets on the pitch at LB with Shaw injured.

988~~~
Daley Blind is weak in the air. To compensate for his vulnerability, LVG tries to include some players who are above average in the air. So far, CBJ doesn't appear to be able to translate his height into actually winning a similar percentage of aerial duals as Darmian or Rojo. As to how Rojo makes the team when he failed to even compete with Alderweireld for Spurs' 2nd goal is beyond me but a quick look at Squawka's stats, does indicate that ability in the air is the one area in which CBJ and Varela appear uncompetitive with the other options for full-back.

989~~~
Hate him!

The Onion. He makes me cry

990~~~
The onion strikes again.

Couldn't have left the winger anymore space if he tried.

991~~~
He is shit, we just have to accept that, for me Smalling's reaction is disappointing.

992~~~
What the hell was he doing for their goal? Criminal defending.

993~~~
Asleep on their goal but he was a bit better going forward today, so there's that.

994~~~
Are you in the wrong thread? Smalling is the one who fell over his own feet and scored an own goal.

Rojo was alright today.

995~~~
If there's a chance of Shaw being fit for the final we should start him.

996~~~
Rojo decided to leave Delefelou in acres of space to go to Lukaku when Smalling was marking him. Delefelou got the ball in acres of space and put the cross in. Yes Smalling's lack of ability on the ball cost us as he tried to go with his strong foot but Rojo caused the whole situation.

997~~~
Yeah, I thought he was decent as well.

998~~~
Watch the replay of their goal. It was terrible defending to leave his man like that.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/ldfp" width="560"></iframe>[/QUOTE]

999~~~
Is there a defender who is less of a defender than him? Terrible all season. Always leaves his man in acres of space, always out of position. Can't remember the last time he made a proper tackle. Need to get rid.

1000~~~
[/QUOTE]

I don´t know, he closed down Lukaku, who was a nightmare for us the entire match, and got back to defend Defalou. Thought that was proper defending, and simply a bonehead play by Chris Smalling.

1001~~~
Don't know why he's starting over Borthwick Jackson tbh.

Ordinary player all round.

1002~~~
IO can only deduce it is because he was LVG's requested signing.

1003~~~
Not a great defender, gets dragged towards the ball leaving players unmarked. That's how the goal came, why was he so out of position.

1004~~~
Brainless and incredibly average

1005~~~
The thing is, he shouldn't be closing down Lukaku and he didn't get back to defend Deulofeu. I actually thought he was better today overall than usual. Although that probably has more to do with how shit his normal performances are.

1006~~~
Don't want to see him here next season.

1007~~~
The criticism he gets is ridiculously harsh  IMO. Thought he played really well, could've had an assist had Rashford not tried to dummy one of his cut backs

1008~~~
Criminal to let Lennon get that dangerous cross in . Everyone knows that Lennon cannot cut in very good with his left.

1009~~~
Hes a shockingly frustrating defender. (by defender I mean left back). He looks like a CB playing there <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1010~~~
I don't even know who's playing where and who's not these days.

Just hoping he won't share Di Maria's fate and bring some of that World Cup magic next season... if he still will be in manager's plans.

1011~~~
TBH, I dont think hes good enough for us. I would have had Darmian (after his performance last game), CBJ and TFM ahead of him as LB. But cant wait until Shaw is back.

1012~~~
If he's good enough for Argentina then we may have a real acclimatization problem with him. I just hope that cig thing is just a smoke screen and he didn't totally drop the ball on he floor like one particular snake.

If that situation will continue then most likely we'll be forced to spend again, especially with Jones having hard time in returning to PL football.

1013~~~
I hope he shares Di Maria's fate and fecks off.

1014~~~
Yeah me too he honks

1015~~~
Terrible player..  Never a utd player and I can't believe we play him over CBJ..  Can't stand him.

1016~~~
I really felt for Darmien today. The kid played perhaps his best game of the season, earning us three vital points midweek. He then promptly gets dropped for Rojo, who has been distinctly average all season. Rojo seems like a good lad, but he's simply not good enough to be a starter for us. At best, a squad player who can fill in at centre or left back when needed. Once Shaw is back, he shouldn't see much of the field. Similarly, I wouldn't drop Blind for him either.

1017~~~
Fights hard but lacks basic intelligence.. I might be wrong though, could be down to fitness and losing a second from tiredness.
Whatever the problem is he should try address it quickly because others are waiting to strut their stuff. 
Overall thought he had a steady game till Lennon went of and initially struggled but managed to actually recover well..then ended game steady again.

1018~~~
Shaw should come back please.

1019~~~
Awful player. Every week he makes a mistake. Rather Darmian play LB.

1020~~~
No matter how many goals he costs us LVG seems to love him.

1021~~~
The Onion
Continuing to make me cry.

What a bag of shit

1022~~~
When he's not playing he's everyone's favourite player; the opposite when he is.

1023~~~
Where the feck is CBJ? Can we not just play Darmian at LB? Can't be worse than Rojo.

1024~~~
He's fecking awful even though some on here will tell you otherwise.

1025~~~
I wonder if he was chosen today for his height for set pieces.

1026~~~
That's because he can do no damage

1027~~~
Terrible player prone to losing concentration. Double whammy.

1028~~~
LvG believe in youths

1029~~~
The guy's a joke. His best attribute is probably his crossing but even then that's like 1 good cross in 5

1030~~~
Dreadful. His crossing is rushed, his defending at set-pieces is abysmal and he's just generally a poor player.

1031~~~
Useless player. Absolutely useless. He gave away the free kick they scored from didn't he? I couldn't quite tell but it looked like standard dim witted Rojo lunging in. Then compounds it with his "marking".

1032~~~
The less we see of him next season, the better.

1033~~~
First name on the team sheet. Along with Carrick, and they both drive me nuts.

1034~~~
Fire this cnut into the sun.

1035~~~
Awful defending on that corner.

1036~~~
He's been Leicester's best player.

1037~~~
Darmian could do a better job at LB. Rojo is trying his best, but his decision-making is letting both him and us down.

1038~~~
Another fantastic LVG signing. "Foundations" indeed...

1039~~~
One of the worst halves I've seen from a professional footballer. Makes Darmian look like Roberto Carlos and he's shit as well.

1040~~~
Think his day needs to end now.

1041~~~
Get rid, fecking awful excuse for a footballer

I could see their goal coming a mile off

1042~~~
Is he new to football?

1043~~~
Truly awful.  How and why did we buy this player?  He can't defend, pass, attack..anything...

1044~~~
Another shocking performance

1045~~~
Can't believe CBJ lost his place to this crap.

1046~~~
Please leave and take LVG with you!

1047~~~
Why does he keep playing over CBJ?

1048~~~
Is, was, and always will be a shit left back. I liked what we saw of him at centre-back, but if he's not trusted to play there then he shouldn't be here.

1049~~~
Let him grow and get better FFS..

1050~~~
Is CBJ still injured? If not, the claim that LVG is a messiah for youth players is as crap as the man himself.

1051~~~
This

1052~~~
he did rabona at WC, guess thats enough for Louie....

1053~~~
In the team for his height but so inept at defending set pieces that his height is irrelevant, as the opposing player nearly always beats him to the ball.

1054~~~
Absolute garbage.

1055~~~
Such a rubbish player. Basing that on two seasons

1056~~~
Terrible player prone to losing concentration. Double whammy

1057~~~
He's basically Father Dougal on a plane.

1058~~~
Puts in a mean looking cross once a game.

1059~~~
Comfortably the worst player in the squad.

1060~~~
Maybe because Smalling decided to take on Huth way beyond our defensive line which gave Morgan a great runway for his header.

1061~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Imagine if Vidic saw that situation, he'd probably rip his fecking hair off.

1062~~~
Get Shaw on

1063~~~
He gets subbed off every match, why start him to begin with?

1064~~~
He is a bit poor. Fellaini would probably be a better choice for Morgan at the set-pieces though.

1065~~~
At no point did Rojo get goal side though, he didn't even try, Morgan literally didn't have to work for the goal at all

1066~~~
He's had an awful game so far.

1067~~~
How the feck is he still getting games for us. I hope to see him sold asap, he is just fecking shit. What has happened to Jackson the young Lb, since he got injured?

1068~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1069~~~
Anddd it was a penalty aswell, get him off otherwise Mahrez will make a fool out of him and he will cost us again.

1070~~~
If Smalling hadn't gone so far off the line the defending would have been easier but because he did it makes defending so much harder because the attacker has the advantage when the ball is coming that way for the defender has to run towards his goal whilst heading the ball in the opposite direction, all while trying to mark a man. That's the point of the line being intact because it's impossible to defend properly otherwise.

1071~~~
A liability

He lost Morgan for their goal and has gone on to lose at e dry other set piece

1072~~~
It's the problem with playing Blind at centre back. You have Rojo picking up some of the opponent's best headers from set pieces.

1073~~~
No idea how he keeps getting played. It's beyond a joke now.

1074~~~
No, that's the downside of playing Rojo

1075~~~
Don't think it was a penalty. Also think the matchup was the problem, nothing much Rojo can do there.

1076~~~
Or don't put Fellaini in the wall during free kicks would help.

1077~~~
Fellaini can't move and therefor can't mark players. When he's attacking he basically stands still inside the box.

1078~~~
Played for u21s. So no. Was making this point yesterday to a friend. CBJ had done as well as Rashford to keep his spot post injury. So this whole LVG youth is bit crap.

1079~~~
He's not worse than Rojo, who has let Morgan have like 3 headers at goal.

1080~~~
I hate this guy

1081~~~
He gets lost so many times we need to get him a GPS... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1082~~~
makes the wrong decision time and time again defensivly and is very predictable offensivly

1083~~~
Any competent left back would've won us that. Martial creates acres of space for him and he does nothing with it beyond standing crosses. No more needs to be said about his defending.

1084~~~
Awful player.

1085~~~
Disgraceful performance.

1086~~~
Honestly one of the worst players we've ever had.

1087~~~
I would rather play Young

1088~~~
I can understand his attacking performances as a LB, if he's really a natural centre back. But then he's fecking atrocious defensively too. What international CB worth their salt loses out to their man on set pieces like that. He's a massive wuss too, never seen him attack the ball in the air, and attracted to the ball like a puppy.

1089~~~
2/5 Center back.
2/5 Full back.

He does a job when you limit your expectations where just doing a job is good enough. Was absolute atrocious today.

1090~~~
QFT

1091~~~
As I said couple of times, van Gaal uses youth only when he has no one else. CBJ is twice the fullback he is, but for some reason Rojo keeps starting.

1092~~~
Absolutely atrocious stuff today. 

1) Lost his man on the goal
2) Gave away what should have been a clear penalty
3) Lost the ball again and again with ridiculous hoofs up the pitch
4) Numerous chances to put a decent cross in and not one was delivered.

1093~~~
His end product, I mean, he must have had about 50 crosses today and about 1 met it's target. Just when you think a player has shown you his full repertoire of shiteness, he goes and shows you more.

1094~~~
Rubbish.

1095~~~
I just don't understand how fecking woeful he's become. He was pretty decent earlier this season, since coming back from injury he's just been dire. Wouldn't mind seeing the back of him.

£16m + Nani's wages, feck me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1096~~~
God he's rubbish.

1097~~~
First half abysmal. 2nd half didn't stand out either way. Tried some high crosses. Tried some low crosses.

Quite how he gets in the team on a regular basis is a mystery because he's been shocking rather too often this season.

1098~~~
The worst part is that if he was any decent as a centre back, he'd be starting there ahead of Blind. Blind is better than him at both LB and CB, and Blind's a midfielder ffs.

1099~~~
A less good version of Liverpool-transfer-request-era Heinze.

1100~~~
Pointless.

Shaw,Bo-Jack,Blind,TFM are all better options.

1101~~~
He's really not very bright is he?

1102~~~
Rojo is going to cost us the FA Cup! - He must be dropped Don't care for who.

1103~~~
Take Mikael Silvestre

- Pace
- Crossing and passing ability
+ Crap tattoos
+ £15m

= Marcos Rojo

1104~~~
It's beyond me how he is still starting every game.

1105~~~
He doesn't do anything well.

1106~~~
Our worst player. I dont get what he tries to do when marking somebody. He doesnt attack the ball, and he doesnt get close enough to the person hes marking to influence them into not scoring / doing what they are trying to do.

Hes a shocking LB and should not be starting over Shaw (when he returns) nor right now over CBJ, TFM or even Darmian.

1107~~~
He's actually not a footballer.

1108~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Oh man

1109~~~
Better in the second half, but that's not surprising given that that first half was one of the worst I've seen in ages.

1110~~~
Worst player I have seen in an United shirt at OT. He honks he shouldn't be playing in front of any the kids we have in the reserves 21s 18s 16s...

1111~~~
I think we would have won today if we had someone else at LB. Rojo was at fault for the goal we conceded and his delivery from crosses today was awful. He had so much time and space down that left side and must of had a good 10 attempts at putting a decent ball in and he failed pretty much every time.

1112~~~
He's a liability on every set piece and somehow draws the toughest assignments, it feels like a penalty every time the opponent  gets a corner.

1113~~~
I can't believe he actually played for Argentina in the last WC and that it took Germany into injury time to score a goal.  He's an awful defender and can't cross worth a lick.

1114~~~
He's terrible. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1115~~~
Not a United level player.

1116~~~
Someone please give me a reason as to why Borthwick Jackson doesn't start ahead of him ?

It's bizarre how he walked straight in and keeps his place despite being consistently poor.

1117~~~
Was at fault too many times today, hopefully Borthwick Jackson gets a look in, even Darmian although i'm not a fan of him playing on the left.

1118~~~
His crossing is one of his better points tbf. Baffling how consistently bad someone can be at defending set pieces though.

1119~~~
I don't know why he keeps getting picked ahead of Darmian, clueless at linking with Martial and dodgy defensively.

1120~~~
Harsh on Agent Silvestre! He was actually a decent leftback; an atrocious centreback though!

1121~~~
Was it <a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a> who told us he was good? Dayum.

1122~~~
I told that he was good for Sporting as center back not as LB. I warned plenty of times that he wasn't good enough for us as LB and that Leonardo Jardim played him exclusively as center back. If you re read my posts about him, i warned about his inconsistencies, being prone to errors and that he needed a strong, disciplinarian manager to get him on the line. He was good enough for us but obviously Manchester United isn't Sporting and Portuguese league isn't the english league. You can't just have Ronaldo's and Nani's (in lesser degree obviously). Take it on the shin mate. You got Ronaldo from us pretty cheap <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1123~~~
There was a moment where Martial received the ball on the left and waited for Rojo to support him, but the useless fecker just stood still and forced Martial to pass it back.

1124~~~
Why did people even think he was good?
I watched him for 7 games in the World Cup and comfortably came to the conclusion he was no good. You could have swapped him for a cone in that Argentina squad and you'd not notice the difference. 
I remember when we were getting linked with him I was annoyed because he managed to be shit at attacking and shit at defending which is generally bad for a full back.

I think people thought he was good because he looked like a good footballer. Snappy hair cut, tattoos, wristbands. Maybe that fooled people into thinking he was good .

1125~~~
Gone backwards this season, time is up. Won't do his job on set-pieces so what's the point in him even starting, Van Gaal deserves criticism for that.

1126~~~
He's not good enough for us not even as back up.

1127~~~
Genuinely worst player I've seen as a United regular. I think Blackett is better much better.

1128~~~
He is bad , but def not as bad as djemba djemba, obertan or taibi

1129~~~
Or Falcao...

Though its close.

1130~~~
I wonder if he's a better central defender? I don't think he has the game to play fullback and CBJ showed more in 12 games then Rojo ever has. We've missed Camerons first time crosses. Why remove that from the team LVG? Absurd that we've ended up with Rojo and Valencia (though he's actually improved somewhat) - Our width just isn't good with Rojo. Putting in a cross people get on the end of is a knack that he don't really have.

1131~~~
I still find it quite annoying that he plays LB while Blind plays CB. That said I don't fave that much faith he'd be significantly better in the centre!

1132~~~
I'm not having that lol taibi perhaps but Djemba x2 and Obertan were far better. Rojo stinks and he cost us today with his shit marking. He's an accident waiting to happen, the sooner he goes the better.

1133~~~
especially given how Borthwick-Jackson and Fosu-Mensah have looked in the games they've played - the odd mistake from those two which is expected for players breaking through.....Rojo is a mistake waiting to happen

1134~~~
Agree but then again I think Fred the Red would be a better player than Rojo

1135~~~
No way. Rojo had an excellent game against City in the first half of the season. Blackett never had a good game, not a single one.

1136~~~
But he still not as bad as Rojo who ends most of our moves and costs us goals

1137~~~
Blackett is worthless but alas so is Rojo. Both nowhere near good enough.

1138~~~
Can we be absolutely certain this isn't some kind of Ali Dia-style joke from Mendes? He's so bad. So very bad.

1139~~~
Don't understand how Rojo can be an utter shambles every game he plays and LVG can drop other players indefinately for being nowhere near as bad

1140~~~
How LVG's handled them is a prime example of why he shouldn't get too much credit for his youth policy. He's gone to the young players only when absolutely necessary and generally hasn't hesitated to drop them as soon as a senior player returns.

1141~~~
Yep. There are obvious double standards. Players like Rojo can play as shit as they like and their starting place is safe, yet once a youngster makes a mistake/has a poor game, he's immediately sent back to the reserves. Varela is still being punished for his poor first half display against Liverpol at Old Trafford. Where are the consequences for that useless shithouse Rojo? Why is CBJ stuck in the reserves while Rojo starts every fecking game? Why was Darmian dropped for Rojo despite assisting the first and scoring the second goal against Crystal Palace? I just don't fecking get it.

1142~~~
Just not good enough

1143~~~
fecking LVG logic.

1144~~~
We payed £15 million, plus Nani and paid Nani's wages for this fraud......

Let that sink in....

1145~~~
I've not liked him from the start and now I despise him. He's shite, and something about him just winds me up. Hope he's sold in the summer.

1146~~~
#TeamSolius

1147~~~
He's absolute trash. Every time he got the ball in a crossing position last night I had no faith it would be anything decent, and defensively he's about as solid as a yoghurt.

1148~~~
He's so shit.

1149~~~
It's like, you want to be so creative in describing how bad he is but, even William Butler Yates and Seamus Heaney couldn't have put it better than this.

He is just so horrible. Save us Luke, you're our only hope!

*Luke Shaw. Not Skywalker

1150~~~
Keep him around as a squad player for CB/LB. Some of the rubbish written on here about some of our players is a joke. He's too much of a headless chicken to start regularly but he is generally quick, strong, knows how to tackle and is eager to get forward. Other than Shaw, who else does that? Yesterday he was always trying to overlap to help Martial out and he put in plenty of decent crosses.

Smalling gets more blame than Rojo for Morgan's goal for breaking the offside line. If he had stayed Morgan was miles offside when the ball was struck.

1151~~~
Considering the above - I'd say he's our worse ever signing.

1152~~~
One of the worst signings we've made in recent times, seemed like it might be the case at the time when we bent over backwards to sign him.

1153~~~
Is this guy seriously an Argentinian international? Unbelievable.

1154~~~
Romero is an Argentine international as well, both are shocking players.

1155~~~
Get him sold.

1156~~~
He's absolutely hopeless

1157~~~
Got skinned by Cameron fecking Jerome.

1158~~~
I love Rojo but he has the attention span of a gold fish. Still reckon he's a good squad player to have.

1159~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I really dont know what his attributes are. He cant really mark at set pieces. His position is horrible. His passing is not great either.

1160~~~
Think we've all seen what we've needed to see. Accepted he's a shit left back but can't do anything in center back either.

Fraud.

1161~~~
#RojoIsRed

1162~~~
He must love Memphis, draws attention away from his shitness.

1163~~~
Going through just an awful, awful patch of form. I hope he can recover, and quick, before the season is over. He wasn't as bad as this last year.

1164~~~
The fact LVG has persisted with Rojo over the last few games shows that all this talk of his youth development was really just bullshit. He did it because he had to and he got away from it as soon as he possibly could.

1165~~~
Sad sight. Looks like another Argie who can make it everywhere but of course not in United.  Is it because of the weather ? Food ? Philosophy ?

Not even close to that crazy lad from World Cup. Hard to believe it's the same person.

1166~~~
He's just not good enough. Bad form or not, a player who performs on this level for such a long period of time is not good enough for a champions league team.

Still maintain he's the worst player to play for us on a consistent basis for a very long time.

1167~~~
He's not even the worst player to play for us on a consistent basis this season.

1168~~~
I'd disagree as I think he's genuinely the worst I've seen at United.

1169~~~
Not sure what to think now. Rojo has demonstrated he is crap at left-back. Last season I thought he was ok as a central defender. On that performance, I'd say he's simply a crap player. Not sure we can afford to get rid of Jones and Rojo this summer.

1170~~~
Worst United defender I have seen. Buttner was far better and he was fecking shit.

1171~~~
I don't think I've ever watched him play and seen him do anything that's made me think that was a good bit of defensive play. Even bad defenders sometimes do something. I've no idea what he's in the team to do.

1172~~~
Strange match. I didn't see the first 6 minutes as the coverage was interrupted or something, but then he was terrible for about 10-15 minutes after that. However, after they had that break in play where CBJ came on for Darmian, Rojo was actually fairly good for the rest of the match. Not amazing, but fairly good.

1173~~~
Started shit and nearly gifted them a goal, settled and did alright, then was shit again towards the end. Kept slipping over like Falcao.

1174~~~
The Onion.

Making United fans cry since 2014

1175~~~
He wasn't that bad, some comments are quite harsh.

1176~~~
Apparently he was vilified to Fellaini levels back in Argentina before world cup 2014. Most supporters saw his inclusion as nepotism because he and the Argentina coach Sabella shared a common background (same hometown and Rojo played under him at Estudiantes). He was seen as the weak link when his name was announced in the final squad

1177~~~
I just don't get this starting LB for Argentina at WC thing. I think some people are a bit behind the times. Like you know in 70s when there was not internet and the world was much more "divided", top leagues did not have the sway and popularity they have now, of course WC was like a football central stage and basically a showcase for football. But it's not anymore. Argentina has shit LBs that's a fact, nobody would name a one really good argentinian LB who would make it in top club. And if Rojo is the least shitiest of them all it does not make him good.
Keep in mind that Demichelis was also in Argentian team, not sure anybody would want him. Netherlands team that also had a good tournament had Vlaar at CB. Other below average players as well. And look at Brazil team, anyone thinks Paulinho or Fred are good enough. Many top national teams have shit players in them in one position or two. That just how it is.

The fact is Rojo was playing at Sporting at 24, that is more or less his level, he can probably play at teams like Everton or Stoke or any other middle table one, he can be a cover for United, although on his salary it's not wise, but as a squad player, not a starting line-up one, but like 16-17 most used players over a season, he just does not cut it.

1178~~~
He should be publicly flogged.

1179~~~
Doesn't even look good enough to play for Aston Villa

1180~~~
I keep hoping he'll have a good game by accident sometime.

1181~~~
No composure. Just cheaply trying whack it away during the build up to their goal. I blame Van Gaal for playing him regularly.

1182~~~
He's a bit shite.

1183~~~
That foul on Antonio. Typical Rojo. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He'd get skinned by Stephen Hawking.

1184~~~
another wonderful performance.

1185~~~
I'd be interested to take a peak at a parallel universe where Shaw never got injured and Rojo didn't feature at left back all season. I think we'd have got top 4.

1186~~~
Contender for the most useless defensive signing for United in the PL era.

1187~~~
I thought he was a bit less shit than usual.

1188~~~
His criticism has been justified in recent weeks but not tonight. He had a good game (one of our best players but that doesn't say much), just the easy target at the moment for some on here

1189~~~
His shit was drowning in the plethora of shit around him making his shit almost unrecognizable.

1190~~~
I'd rather he just put the ball out for a throw in than attempt those useless crosses.

1191~~~
That could be it, there was a lot of shit out there surrounded by a sea of shit and Sky shit to boot, overall a shitty night.

1192~~~
He's shit.

1193~~~
When he gets the ball the attack is over.

1194~~~
He's just awful, fecking awful.

1195~~~
Half the team are shit tbf.

1196~~~
He needs to be the first one on the plane to China.

1197~~~
No more. That should be his last game for us.

1198~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1199~~~
The worst regular starting defender I've seen at this club.

Hell, he's even worse then a lot of our non-regularly starting defenders of yore.

1200~~~
Just how bad must this guy be at centre back for Blind to be a better option?

1201~~~
I like the guy, but he's simply not good enough.

1202~~~
Total shite.

Should be the first out the door in the Summer. Or actually 2nd, after Van Gaal.

1203~~~
He's the softest hard man I've ever seen... He's neither a decent footballer nor an enforcer. 
Brutal, yet keeps getting picked & keeps lasting 90mins. Would be baffling if we didn't have such a completely clueless manager.

1204~~~
Just bizarre given van Gaal's propensity for replacing full backs.

1205~~~
Hope he's driving the taxi when LVG finally fecks off he's shockingly bad.

1206~~~
I think he's the worst defender I've ever seen play for us. Continues to astound with his performances and I don't even think he's Championship quality. Pick any random shit club in the prem and I'd take their left back over this numpty.

1207~~~
My mate who's an Arsenal fan said tonight, it was making him angry seeing someone as bad as Rojo in the number 5 shirt for United, which says a lot.

1208~~~
Looked like he could be a decent squad player for us when he first started but towards the end of this season he has been a walking disaster no matter where they play him in defence.
I don't think I could ever be comfortable watching one of our games with him at the back.

1209~~~
Hes not a United player. Hes not a good CB, hes an even worse LB. His crossing ability is terrible. And as a LB he cant drive us forward. And he cant even defend.

Said it after the last game, but I seriously dont know what his attributes are.

1210~~~
We play like we've still got Evra in the team, shifting the ball wide to valencia 1 side, then switching back to Rojo who is all by himself with all the time in the world to do something. 

He then proceeds to offer no ability to take a man on, and puts in some of the most pointless crosses I've ever seen. He never whips them in with pace or keeps them low, he delicately dinks them high up into the air for the keeper to easily grab. He is massively frustrating.

1211~~~
LVG'S personal signing this one after scouting him in the WC, he must be hung like an elephant.

1212~~~
Charlatan. Fecker is pretending to be a footballer.

1213~~~
I don't get how every player gets benched as soon as they make a single mistake, and yet Rojo keeps on getting picked and rarely subbed. It's like he has the same undroppable status in the squad as Rooney, or something.

1214~~~
Butters was better.

Though atleast he got stuck in tonight which is more than I can say for some.

Personally I'd never sign another Argy ever again.

1215~~~
This

Heinze, Veron, Di Maria, Tevez, Rojo, Romero...they've either flopped or pissed off the fans. Such a poor record.

1216~~~
Dumbest player ever in a United shirt.

1217~~~
I don't doubt that he's trying hard, but at this point all he's really trying is my patience.

1218~~~
waste of time and money, rather give chance to CBJ and Joe Riley than waste time on him

1219~~~
I can't defend him. Usually I find something to support a United player about, but he's giving me nothing to work with here.

1220~~~
Hate him! Absolutely hate him! 

A disgrace to Patrice and Denis!

1221~~~
The least you can do after a defeat is go over to the fans, ffs. He'll surely leave in the summer. Barca were linked to him again just last month... here's hoping.

1222~~~
What, feck off?! Barcelona?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Him over Jordi Alba?! How much have you drank? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1223~~~
It would be funny to see him there. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I said it in jest, but weirdly he was linked to them last summer and again last month. If it's, shockingly, true that they want him then their scout must be Andrea Bocelli.

1224~~~
Seriously he put in some promising performances last year and one this year against Man City. What has happened to all of our players? We actually started the season well...and look at us. Can't wait for Shaw to come back.

My God, I sound like an Arsenal fan.

1225~~~
Romero haven't had enough time or impact to say flopped though.

But I agree with the rest. We don't seem to have any luck with them. And I think even SAF said or hinted that he would never sign one again back then.

1226~~~
Alba isn't a CB.

1227~~~
Even worse....They're going to slot this clown in ahead of Pique and Masherano?

1228~~~
Is every player bought to be in the starting lineup?

1229~~~
OK.....So Barcelona, are going to spend money, to put this clown on the bench? 

I understand there is natural reflex to defend United players but, it's absolutely laughable to suggest he could be a part of a modern day Barcelona squad

1230~~~
He's simply not that good a player. He's had some good moments here and there, but they've been way too few and far between. On current form, he's quite a liability. Every game he seems to make fundamental errors that result in chances, if not goals, against. De Gea must find it so frustrating watching Rojo play in that back four. His positional awareness and discipline is shocking at times. At best, a squad player.

1231~~~
If that is true he can just leave now. His footballing skill has been non evident and his footballing brain is even worse. I originally thought he was a good guy and passionate footballer - but that's gone too. I can't believe we went through all that fuss to sign a player like him.

1232~~~
16 million, plus Nani on loan and we paid Nani's wages.........

1233~~~
He can fill the left footed CB who never plays role currently filled by Vermaelen. Although Vermaelen with whatever his latest injury is, is still better than Rojo.

1234~~~
I don't know, I don't work for Barcelona.

1235~~~
Which makes it (random guess) a combined fee of like 22m for Rojo. 22m for a player like Rojo - just because he was left footed.

1236~~~
Im not sure if he was ever good enough, at least not after the left backs we've had at United, but when pretty much all the squad turns to shit, i'd say the management is to blame.

1237~~~
He was shit last season and he's been shit this season.
Shit at Left Back, shit at Center Back.
Just absolute dogshite. Get rid.

1238~~~
No love for Poch?

1239~~~
He's a big guy but he gets beat for everything. Plays at LB and he doesn't know what to do with the ball, yet he plays every game. Tells you all you need to know about the club

1240~~~
Thing is, a lot of players in the squad are underperforming. You can see they're short of confidence or playing against instinct and making mistakes. But when I look at him I don't feel like there's more to come, he's just shit

1241~~~
He's never a left back and isn't good enough to start at centre back. However like all players to get the best of them they need a run of games in their BEST position.

After his transfer dealings this is my biggest gripe with LvG. Rojo, Blind, Schneiderlin, Rooney, Mata and Lingard have all been played out of position.

1242~~~
If this guy is going to look like a CB playing at LB could he not at least look like he is actually a CB.  What is his actual preferred 1st choice position?

1243~~~
I can see Barcelona getting him. After all, they spent 30 million for Mathieu.

1244~~~
Can't decide what is worse, his skills as a footballer or his hair

1245~~~
What is this Giggs obsession of having players applauding the fans after yet another shit performance where the fans felt cheated by these overpaid bunch of idiots? Is that how he kept his wife at bay for years?

1246~~~
No idea but, I bet he's feeling the cold now since Fergie and pals have gone quiet on him. Fergie has a new pet he loves to talk about and take to lunch

1247~~~
I don't like Rojo. I think he's a waste of money but he's right on this one. This constant going over to the fans after yet another gutless performance is pathetic. There's a limit to how much the fans can be taken for a ride.

1248~~~
It's shocking, isn't it? As someone mentioned above, Rojo is one of LVG's recruits, so he gets a pass. Cameron or Fosu-Mensah should be playing in his spot. If either of them had performed like Rojo, they would be frozen out.

1249~~~
If we are talking managers then yeah, I'd probably take Maradona with Ossie Ardiles as his assistant than the current set up!

1250~~~
Can someone tell me what are Rojo's strengths as a player?

1251~~~
with all due respect but you can probably play in his spot and do a better job in that. He's shit. The only one who would probably do worse is Mcnair.

1252~~~
Explain yourself

1253~~~
I think Blackett would give him a run for his money as well.

But, as to my question - what are Rojo's strengths? A player doesn't get to be a regular for Manchester United and Argentina without having some real strengths

1254~~~
Pulling the wool over his manager's eyes?

1255~~~
He is poor offensively. .  Once in 12 matches.. he has a good cross.. rash defensively. . Would have been better to have CBJ play the last few games

1256~~~
Left footed.

1257~~~
Rojo gets a hard time. He's very obviously playing out of position and it shows. Whether it be going forward or back the way, he struggles out wide.

He's a lot better at centre half and it's fair to say he's never had a proper crack of the whip in that position.

Unless we're planning on pushing through the likes of Fosu-Mensah, Williams and Tuanzebe into proper first team players (which I wouldn't mind at all) we'd be best off keeping Rojo for cover.

1258~~~
He's not better at center half. Poor positioning, rash and tends to give the ball away in dangerous areas because he fancies himself as a passer when in fact he's quite shit at that as well.

1259~~~
So is my mum

1260~~~
And CBJ

1261~~~
A centre back? He's barely a footballer.

1262~~~
My bad!

1263~~~
He has plenty of good crosses. United are just awful in offence, simply awful. No more than 2 players inside the box at a time and the build-up is so slow that when he manages to get into a crossing position the opposition has 5-6 players inside the box ready to head the ball away.

United is probably the worst team in the league in the air. Our biggest players can head the ball away but Smalling and Fellaini are poor inside the opposition box. Unless you pass exactly where Fellaini is he won't do anything and Smalling is just not good at heading the ball.

Rojo's mistakes have been highlighted more than anyone's and it doesn't help that people think that "all Argentinians playing for United are rubbish" hoodoo that people believe. We've had to deal with ridiculous injuries in defense as you well know and our left half has been filled with makeshift players. Both Blind and Rojo have had to fill in a position that isn't their strongest and overall have done well as a unit. Our main culprits have been our attackers but like the defense they've also been shifted all over the place in numerous formations.

I'm not gonna get on the Rojo hate train because he's been no worse than Rooney, Herrera, Lingard, Mata, Darmian, Schneiderlin, Carrick...basically everyone's been worse overall than Smalling, Blind, De Gea and Martial. That's the state of our team at the moment and I'm going to reserve my judgement until a new managers deals with the players. If he cuts anyone of them I won't go mental but it won't be surprising if he doesn't either.

1264~~~
I thought that both Tevez and Heinze were pretty good

1265~~~
Yeah but one moved to a rival and the other wanted to.

1266~~~
At least we probably won't have that problem with Rojo!

1267~~~
I'd actually forgive his poorness if he moved to a rival.

1268~~~
He is a garbage centre back and simply a catastrophic left back. There are very few - if any - defenders worse than him in the league. He just cannot defend, he's positionally appalling and makes Phil Jones look as calm as Rio Ferdinand. But this was all part of the philosophy apparently:

Our great LvG with a keen eye for talent as always. We can add that to his many other managerial skills.

1269~~~
See, he's really not that bad. He had good games at centre half last season and was doing well until he got an injury that more or less ended his season.

This season he must have played about three games in his proper position. He's no world beater, but he's a lot better than you describe.

1270~~~
Sorry but he is really, really poor. He just seems so 'meh' at everything. Almost like a teenager in a man's body. Tactically inept, average in the air, average pace but puts himself about so people think 'at least he is trying'.

1271~~~
Some poster said a few days ago that Rojo'd even get skinned by Stephen Hawking. It really sums him up.

1272~~~
He'd probably get skinned by his unborn child

1273~~~
One of the worst players we've ever signed. William Prunier level.

1274~~~
Bring back Jonny Evans <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1275~~~
Not so sure, Leeds may want him!

1276~~~
Not this season he looks like he's been playing for a move. He's been awful and every time he gets the ball he is 50/50 to lose possession. Truly aweful buy.

1277~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1278~~~
No coincidence that the left pie chart looks like a pacman laughing his hole off at us for having to endure that felt tip-covered twat every week.

1279~~~
I'm actually a bit surprised about how underwhelming he's been. Maybe it's LvG, because I really don't think Rojo is that bad.

1280~~~
That is why these kind of stats are bullshit and shouldn't be used as a defense for anyone. 

How this guy got in ahead of CBJ is beyond me. fecking LVG.

1281~~~
It really is inexplicable. My view may be colored by my irrational dislike for Rojo, but I have no idea why someone who prides himself on bringing through youth would ever pick a journeyman like Rojo over a young, local talent like CBJ.

1282~~~
On form, he in no way deserves to start.  Maybe the bench because of TFM's injury, that is all.  Has been shocking the last few games and might be another player that LVG has fallen out with.

1283~~~
lol

1284~~~
Rojo has to play.... who else is going to do a shit job of marking Scott Dann at corners?!

1285~~~
Even they play different positions. Rojo is in the squad to play Copa America, but Dybala is not selected <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1286~~~
Rojo is red? Rojo is shite!

1287~~~
What other fullback options do Argentina have? Much easier task to make it at fullback there than to try and get into an attack that features Messi, Aguero, Higuain, Di Maria, etc. Maybe should have been ahead of Lavezzi and Gaitan, mind.

1288~~~
You are right. I forgot that Rojo plays as left back for Argentina. I was thinking as CB when they have Funes Mori, Otamendi, Roncaglia, Garay, etc. However, Dybala could have been in the squad instead of Lamela or Lavezzi.

1289~~~
Aye, there's definitely room for Dybala, but at the moment Rojo basically gets a free pass. I mean the only other LB I can even think of is Jonathan Silva at SCP, who'd brilliant on Football Manager but probably not good enough/ready in real life.

1290~~~
He and Darmian are two of the most pointless players ever. When they aren't shite they have to be subbed off.

1291~~~
Hopefully he is LVGs taxi driver to the airport

1292~~~
Put his best ball of the match in after he got injured.

1293~~~
Battle of the brains, or lack thereof, down his side of the pitch. Rojo against Zaha, two meat heads who gym a lot and just happens to kick a ball really well.

Yet another positionally shit game from him. It's course for the norm now whenever Rojo plays. Always going after the ball and leaving your damn position.

1294~~~
Unless CBJ was injured, he was very very unlucky to miss out to Rojo at LB. Still failing to see what his attributes are.

1295~~~
The guy might be not up to standard. But, i like him for his passion for United. Even Shaw said so.

1296~~~
Not a nice thought but I have to admit once it was  obvious he'd not been seriously hurt, broken leg or anything, I was glad he had to go off.

1297~~~
should go for a better player coming in

1298~~~
Fashionable to hate him but he was absolutely fine today. He was supporting Martial well on the left. Not our best ever left back but today he played well.

1299~~~
Mourinho is great at developing defensive players - hopefully he can make something useful out of Rojo or its curtains for him. He's been utterly wank this season.

1300~~~
For me he's potentially really useful with his ability to play two positions, problem is he's never fit when needed.   He's a back up's back up, 3rd choice at left back for me behind Shaw and CBJ, and maybe just about back up at CB.

1301~~~
Seriously what were we thinking signing this player, a third part legal tangle, £16 million, and Nani's wages for a year, for what? A bang average player that will no be a pain in the neck to move on.


I'm just glad we have a manager now that won't sign a player just because he looked quite good for a couple of games during an international tournament.

1302~~~
Mourinho has admitted to signing Djilobodji without ever having seen him play.

1303~~~
I thought he'd be a great CB for us, but he's hopeless.

Wouldn't miss him.

1304~~~
Like SAF and mourinho have had no failures.

1305~~~
IIRC Van Gaal's only justification for wanting him was that he is left footed and could play some short passes. 

Atleast we didn't get Vermalaen.

1306~~~
#rojoisshit 

Always was, I don't really know what people were expecting from him never was good enough for us and never will be

1307~~~
He is a decent player and not worse than our other defenders bar Blind. I am not counting Shaw as we have barely seen him at United.

He is also a starter for a team which has reached 3 finals in 3 years. really good for such a useless player if you believe the Caf.

1308~~~
He's not where close to being worst player I've seen at United, but there's nothing particularly great about him either. Hope he moves on and enjoys the rest of his career elsewhere.

1309~~~
Smalling is far, far better than him. Jones is probably better too, but he doesn't count cause he's always injured.

1310~~~
Smalling is very overrated on the Caf, and I have given up all hope on Jones.

1311~~~
Smalling is very overrated here, but he is still far better than Rojo. Rojo just isn't that good, while Smalling is a good player.

I would say that from our CBs, Smalling and Blind are around the same level, Jones a level below them, with Rojo a level below Jones. No idea about Baily.

1312~~~
Rojo is horrendous. Been terrible since day 1 and looks horribly out of position no matter where he plays. Positionaly awful, sloppy passing, shite going forward, reckless and just completely shite all round. 

Seems a nice guy though.

1313~~~
That team also has the most talented player in the world, Aguero, di Maria, Pastore, Higuain and more.

Not very good players can reach a lot in a great team. Valdes wasnt the best keeper in the world but did win everything multiple times.

1314~~~
Still it was mainly their defence which put them through to the WC final.

1315~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> nice ending to that post.

1316~~~
Not sure I said they didn't, just that Rojo was seemingly bought on a whim and was a complicated deal at that, but yes of course you are correct Fergie and Mourinho were/are not foot perfect in the transfer market, what was I thinking for not making that clear in my post.

1317~~~
Didn't they play with wing backs or with very defensive midfielders? 

It's why players like Darmian (for his tactical nous and ability to overlap) and Moreno (good going forward) can thrive and look very good in a 5 man defence set up. Random examples as there are more but my mind is blank lol.

1318~~~
Moreno looks bad defensively in every setup. Darmian is a much better defender. Different class going forward.

1319~~~
^Haven't seen much of him at Liverpool but I think he has good technique and energy but definitely a bit clueless defending. However, you can mostly get away with that in a wing back position as long as you do the basics ok, which I'm sure even someone like him and Rojo can do (just track runners, help your centre backs and make yourself as an option on the ball).

1320~~~
Won't be surprised with him staying and at least 35 combined apps over the four competitions. Mou loves these temperamental, hard nosed defenders. Could see the 2 starting CB spots be a toss up between Smalling, him, and Bailly, with Mike having a small advantage.

Ideally, Blind should be thee, but I don't think Mou will see him as a defender, unless it's cover for the full back position.

1321~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Even funnier that it's the only thing wrong in that post! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Sometimes truth is harsh. No need to make it any less <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1322~~~
The difference is, Mourinho demands his CBs to be tactically disciplined. And Rojo is anything but that. In my 20+ years of watching United, I've not seen a specialist defender so woefully out of position so often. Rojo plays like a naive, all-action meathead that puts in maximum effort but flatters to deceive. Shite player for a top club. Sell.

1323~~~
Got sent off for this

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/zct1" width="560"></iframe>

Can't really tell if that's worth a red, but it looks like the sort of challenge Rojo would put in. His tackling style could do with a little bit of refining, he always manages to make challenges look worse then they actually are. Still, pretty feckin' harsh on the bloke...

EDIT:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/zje3" width="560"></iframe>

1324~~~
Looked harsh, should probably be a yellow. The ref was probably trying to even things up with Chile having already had a player sent off. Having said that though his foot was high and if he had have connected with vidal then would defo be a red. Harsh but can understand why it was red.

1325~~~
Never a red

1326~~~
Terrible player. Hope he's kicked out sharpish.

1327~~~
No it's not, but his tackling style just makes it look worse then it actually is.

I do think the way he tackles in general is pretty poor ... pretty sure I've seen him go in two feet on more then one occassion (not high, just with two feet)  which to me is always an indicator that a player might not have great technique in the tackle.

1328~~~
Well i agree with you. He can't tackle for shit, but that foul was a yellow card worthy and nothing more.

1329~~~
He just seems to be prone to switching off and letting players move away from him but his tackling is wild at times, he just flies in recklessly. His compatriot  Heinze was a very aggressive tackler in his time at OT, but he did it properly for the most part, letting his man know he was there, as opposed to Rojo who just dives in. Rojo just seems to be afflicted by the red mist at times, he lets it cloud his judgement in all aspects of his game, you often see him getting riled up by opponents who probably know exactly what they are doing, goading him into an impetuous challenge or lack of concentration on the game.

1330~~~
I don't know if that's still the case but tackles from behind that a player can't see coming used to be red cards all the time.

That being said it actually looks like he isn't even fully hitting Vidal and he goes down way before there is even any contact.

1331~~~
That is never a red card. It looks worse, but he actually barely touches him. There was absolutely no malice in the tackle, yellow would have been the right choice.

1332~~~
I'm not a massive fan of him but that was never a red card <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1333~~~
Red card aside, how did he play for Argentina during the Copa? I didn't catch a single game.

1334~~~
No, that's how fans and the odd pundit interpreted it but it was never a law. It's never been an automatic foul let alone a red.

A tackle has always been a tackle = get the ball and it's not a foul.

Giggs used to tackle people from behind all the time. The super fluid slide, wrap his leg, win the ball and stand up in one motion thing.

There's such a thing as 'tackling with excessive force' where you can technically get the ball first, but only because you've clearly been willing to hit the player as a side effect. That's normally blown up for or card worthy.

1335~~~
Is it just me or is there no contact there? He also gets the ball. Vidal's leg buckling under him is hardly Rojo's fault.

1336~~~
You are probably right but I somehow remember that a few years back at least in the Bundesliga tackles from behind were a hot topic and always got called as a foul if you only somehow touched the opposition player. The argument was that tackles from behind carry an increased injury risk and are therefor to be punished as dangerous play and I can remember quite a few situation where a foul not hard or anything special but from behind was punished with a straight red card. Haven't seen that in a while though.

And then there is this:

Vidal indeed seems to go down before there is any contact at all and in the end there doesn't seem to be any and Rojo gets the ball as well, pretty weird to give a red for this. Maybe the ref felt the need to balance out the game again. I hate decisions like that when refs try to correct earlier bad, in their eyes, decisions with another bad decision. That just makes anything worse. You can't correct a precieved mistake through making an intentional wrong decision. Or maybe he is just shit and gave in to the pressure of the players surrounding him.

1337~~~
How in the name of God is that a red card? He barely touches Vidal at all. In fact it's not even a yellow, more or less a perfect tackle despite it being from behind.
