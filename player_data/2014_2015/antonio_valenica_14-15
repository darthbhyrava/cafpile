Dear God.

39 Backwards or Square passes, 20 forward passes.
0/1 Take On
0/4 Crosses

and for Balance, 1 assist which obviously makes up for everything and absolves him of any criticism.

2~~~
I want to chop his right foot off just to see what happens when a ball touches his left.

3~~~
The Sunderland player was stupid for the first goal, once he showed Valencia onto the left he was useless. The lack of penetration down the flanks was the biggest reason we sucked today. Just kept playing it back inside and doing nothing with it. He's even worse without a full back overlapping him.

4~~~
He got an assist while taking on his man, but for some reason reverted to spend rest of the game playing the ball inside to central midfielders most of the time when he got the ball. Seriously, infuriating player to watch.

5~~~
Just isn't a WB. No defensive ability in his game at all. Not much else tbh when he's going forward. Sideways passing rather than taking on his man.

6~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The inverted commas.

He's one of the most culpable for slowing our play down. Gets in a good position then predictably stops to either cut back or yet again over run the ball because he daren't take on his man or use his left foot. Replacing him with Januzaj or Di Maria would be an obvious improvement on the wings, though would probably leave us yet more fragile at the back.

7~~~
He was good defensively. He won the ball a lot down sunderlands left. Poor going forward but that's the norm.

8~~~
When trying to think of something constructive to say regarding Valencia there is just a void in my mind.

All I will say is that if he were a horse I'd give him the bullet.

9~~~
Back in the team and slipping back into his bad old ways. We know what our expectations are for wingers and he's not living up to them. They show him onto his left and the ball goes infield over and over again.

Hopefully Di Maria will give us that penetration we're lacking from the wings and reduce the amount of our play from the right. As an attacking force, Valencia's just living on past glories.

10~~~
Rafael would offer more going forward.

11~~~
We will play better by starting with 10 men, rather than playing him.

Utterly abysmal

12~~~
I love the use of "" in the title.

13~~~
He'll have to be fit first.

14~~~
He was shit. Not as shit as Clev, Fletch, Young, Mata or Rooney but still shit.

15~~~
For me he was a positive. I watch Juve a lot and thats the sort of performance I've seen from WB, solid defensively and so so going forward.

16~~~
He was so cowardly in the 2nd half. Ample 1 on 1 opportunities yet he passed it back inside and ruined our momentum rather than take responsibility to make something happen.

Credit for the assist mind, the one time he did find his bollocks.

17~~~
It's such a shame seeing him this way, he used to be able to storm past defenders with ease. Now he's just frightened of it. He did it once today and managed an assist.

Can't wait until we get to see Di Maria over this dross.

18~~~
Thought apart from the mistake for their goal, he was actually OK defensively. There was one moment in particular when Sunderland would have been in on goal and he got an important touch away. His strength was good and held off people, shielding the ball well.

Offensively he was poor though, the assist aside. Yorke was right when said that it should have given Valencia confidence but he looked afraid to take on the left back as though he'd forgotten there was no Rafael to bail him out.

Not a good performance but Young, Cleverley and Fletcher were worse by some distance in my opinion.

19~~~
I still can't believe we handed this a guy a 3 year contract.

20~~~
Can you please explain how not marking the man he was supposed to be marking on a set piece counts as being solid defensively?

21~~~
You should say this in regards to Young. Valencia is any day better than him.

22~~~
Can't play right wing. Can't play right back. Can't play wing back. Can't shoot. Can't cross. Can't pass. Can't dribble past people. Given a new contract.

23~~~
He was fine today and pretty solid defensively 2nd half in particular.

Gave the assist for the goal  (Which should count as a take on won) and lost the man for their goal defending a corner so that's a negative.

24~~~
Yeah, that's the sort of performance Holland's wingbacks gave as well. Plus he assisted the goal.

25~~~
It's amazing that we have a new system and new manager yet we STILL have Valencia and Young stinking up our wings.

26~~~
The most irritating thing about him, is that he will undertake almost any amount of physical contortions, and waste countless passing and shooting opportunities just to avoid using his left foot.

It's not even a case of working a better opportunity, it's a case of a pass could be there if he just side foots it with his left, but he would rather spin 270 degrees or dislocate his hip to use his right.

It's almost as if he doesn't believe his left foot exists.

27~~~
The wingback role is absolutely 100% the best role for Valencia. It makes it understandable when he doesnt create as much as a winger, puts some value in his tackling but doesn't give him completely responsibility defensively, which is good because Valencia has no idea how to position himself or mark defensively.

And he's still very average. In fact Ashley Young performs better in the role than Valencia does.

We're out of roles to try and make Valencia look good.

28~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> glad they don't go unnoticed.

29~~~
We possess the only two wingers in world football who don't possess a single trick between them. No nutmegs, no stepovers, no Cruyff turns, no Zidane dragbacks, nothing.

30~~~
Here was at fault for the goal,you right there. That happens though. I'm just pointing out his overall play. He did create our goal.

31~~~
I don't think he will survive long under LVG

32~~~
Going on 3 years now.

Why are any of you surprised?

He isnt worth his place,nevermind his new contract.

33~~~
He did, with the one good thing he did offensively. A low smash across goal.

Defensively he won a bunch of tackles, but defending is more than tackling. Its about covering space, marking, etc. And with those actions Valencia looks clueless.

34~~~
Dont stress out over Antonio my man. He aint a big issue at the moment for me. We have Di Maria coming in to sure up our wing play and dont forget about Rafael.

35~~~
I'm just amazed that he's not applying himself better. He's not a right back, we know and understand that. And he's had no attacking play to his game for years so he was clearly at the end of his career as a winger for us. So it all seemed perfect that now we're playing wingbacks.

And somehow he thinks its okay to put in mediocre performances in that role too

36~~~
My favourite moment of the game today was when Cleverley played a long ball out to him on the wing, and then because a defender was close to him, he moved away from the wing and pretended the pass was too high for him, even though it bounced about half a metre before it went off the pitch. 

Surely when you do things like that you must feel like the world's smallest man?

37~~~
Not meaning to sound like a nancy, but that title is a bit unnecessary. I'm not a big fan of Valencia, but he's still a United player. To be insulted already from the title is a bit harsh

38~~~
The search for an efficient attacking display from Valencia goes on. 2011/12 seems like a million miles away.

39~~~
Today the LB sussed him out, showed him to his left and Valencia crumbled every time. He has 0 belief in himself.

40~~~
I remember that moment as well. Its sad since Young was considerably worse than him so Valencia's performace isn't under scrutiny. His new contract is looking more and more like the one we needlessly handed Nani last season. Just baffling...

41~~~
He's an absolute fecking coward. Can't stand him.

42~~~
I don't know if it was down to watching the triple death trap of Fletcher, Cleverlessly and Young today but Valencia actually looked decent. Sure he could have taken on the left back more in one on one situations but when he did he produced the one good chance of the game for us. He did however go ahead and screw himself up with his mistake on the corner that led to their goal.

43~~~
On the plus side, he's one of our few players who possesses this magically thing known as a "first touch" and so can actually control the ball.

The problem is he normally does feck all after that point... and the one time where he actually attempted do something that could be considered slightly dangerous (i.e take his man on), we scored a sodding goal... which you might have thought would be the catalyst for him to try it more often... but no, he just reverted to passing it backwards 5 yards from then on in.

Still, at least he passed it reasonably accurately.

44~~~

45~~~
Every LB has him sussed out. Two years ago. All anyone has to do is push him onto his left, and 99.9% of the time it'll result in a short back pass infield.

He's been unable/unwilling to work on a solution, hence the completely inept performances.

46~~~
He and Young need to start making runs behind the defense. They're making it much harder on the midfielders. The fact that they don't dribble either means it's too easy for them to focus on the front 3.

47~~~
This guys found out. unfortunate but he's had an epic fall from grace. I have lost any sentimentality I held for some of our players. How he was given a new contract is beyond me. We desperately need rid of players like him.

48~~~
I don't think I have ever seen such a one-footed player. It is remarkable the way he refuses to use his left foot, and remarkable that he made it to Manchester United being able to only use one foot.

49~~~
He's not a coward. Tom Cleverley is a coward, Valencia is just shit.

50~~~
Good thing we have him tied for the next 3 years.

51~~~
I really remember this too, I was like "wtf, the ball wasn't that high, he could have controlled it"

52~~~
He was ok defensively yesterday but if he continue to put in performance like this offensively I wouldn't start him ahead of Lingard let alone Rafael.

53~~~
He's lazy - a professional footballer with nothing else to do all day can work on his wrong foot to the point where it is at least functional. Quite why a supposedly elite club hasn't forced him to do so is another question.

54~~~
He makes Young look like Luis Figo. 

He makes me want to claw my eyes out.

55~~~
Why are people saying he was good defensively when he was the man assigned to mark Rodwell?

56~~~
One second in a match defines an overall performance?

57~~~
New season, same Valencia. To think we all once viewed him as a major asset. Now I wouldn't even play him in our 2nd string team. He's fecking useless.

58~~~
He's worse than useless. He's been a fecking liability going forward for 3 seasons running now and still gets in the team.

59~~~
He was solid defensively apart from the mistake that cost us a goal.

60~~~
Whenever he is on defensive duties his positoning almost always leads to a chance for the opposition at some point.

61~~~
He does have this issue. A drawback considering he has played as a winger for basically all of his career though. Luckily his pace means he can recover <i>most </i>of the time.

62~~~
Yup, making him another player whose wages we'd have to pay if we ever wanted to offload him.

63~~~
Let us put aside all emotions and prejudices for moment and let us look at him objectivley. I talkes with some mates who are Gooners this weekend, and while they don't particularly care for United, they are usually fair when assesing rival squads.

Basically, they both said the current Valencia was one of the if not THE worst winger in the league. Never mind his awful "stats", his contribution to our build-up and general offensive play is also beyond depressing.

I know bashing players after a dissapointing result seems childish, but this guy has been a liabilty for two years now.

64~~~
Did ok defensively but offered not much going forward except for the assist. Just not good enough for United anymore

65~~~
The most frustrating thing for me about Valencia s that people say 'he's got no left foot' because of his refusal to use it (he'll do a 360 just to avoid it). However, the rare times he's used it from memory it's been perfectly fine. Against Villa last year when he was on fire he put in a dangerous left foot cross that Giggs nearly got on the end of early on, then played that quality reverse through ball Welbeck using his left also. In the past, I'm sure he's even got assists with it, so why doesn't he use it more often? His whole game for us up to 2012 was going past a man and firing in a cross along the 6 yard line (like he did yesterday) but obviously now full backs show him inside. If he could just show the opposition a decent left foot cross they'd be more chance of space opening up on the outside.

66~~~
<a class="username" data-user="44029, @Pexbo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44029/">@Pexbo</a> - You should make a Michael Keane thread. The lad is a bit of a unit.

67~~~
But the most annoying thing is that he doesn't even attempt to take on his man. When he does square up in an one-on-one situation, he tends to look rather dangerous. 

It's obvious that Van Gaal has told the players to pass it square if there is nothing on, which is why Valencia hasn't even tried to take on his man in the first 2 games, apart from the one time, where we scored. But surely that should be one of the winger's duties - to take on their player when 1 v 1, and create something using technique and pace.

Nah, he was caught napping a few times. Jones did a terrific job making up for "wing-backs'" mistakes.

68~~~
Errr people aren't literally saying he doesn't have a left foot, they're saying he doesn't use it...

69~~~
I honestly thought he was one of our better players yesterday, doesn't deserve the hate he gets here. I'm not saying he was good, but certainly better than Cleverley, Fletcher, Rooney and RVP. Arguably not worse than any of the others.

70~~~
LB's didn't suddenly figure out how to stop him. The trick to stopping him has always been apparent but he was still good enough to go past them. For the last 3 years though, it's like someone has sliced his balls off. He could be 1v1 against his full back and he'll still around 180 and pass it back to Rafael.

71~~~
OK fine. The point is, he only needs to show the left back he can actually produce something when shown inside on his left and they'll be more space for him to exploit on his stronger foot.

72~~~
We sent Nani away and kept this shit on a stick

73~~~
His positioning is fine. He's just shit in the air. Always has been. I remember when people were talking about converting him to right back a year or two ago - I was saying the same thing then.

74~~~
I think honestly people are expecting too much attacking contributions from the wingbacks because the midfield and front 3 didn't cobble up one chance together. Also due to lack of control The ball went to them  without even having a running start on the fullback most of the time.

Once the midfield is controlling the match and we have front 3 moving around playing short passes intricately then it becomes less of a problem as they can be supplementary attackers and arrive on the scene once there is a opening like it happens for Juventus for example.

Or we could go defensive and have a attacking outlet centrally like a Robben play on the counter.

We could ofcourse upgrade their as well and find a Cafu, Roberto Carlos but finding the right balance is becoming a problem.

75~~~
and that is really saying something.

76~~~
This thread title. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I've never been a huge fan of Valencia. He's just such a boring player, and for a club that prides itself on exciting attacking footballers, especially wingers, it makes me wonder how he's lasted this long.

77~~~
It baffles me that any player can play for a top club whilst being quite so one-footed as Valencia. I have never seen such a one-footed player in my life.

Valencia does have some good attributes, he has power, pace, work ethic, but his technical attributes leave a lot to be desired.

78~~~
Valencia has wonderful pace and power still so he's a decent squad player to have....If he can find relearn how to beat his man and get those low crosses in then he can be of benefit to us but yesterday he just opted for the easy option nearly every time yet even though he ws very average - compared to the likes of Cleverley, Fletcher and Mata at least Valencia showed a little balls

79~~~
He's just a massive oaf. For someone so quick he's got a terrible leap and usually prefers to barge them in the back and concede a freekick.

80~~~
Why has happened to him? I mean seriously? From our player of the season a few years back, to one of our worst players now. Is it even possible to regress that much?

81~~~
Valencia flowchart
Is it on my left? -> Oh god, run in a circle
Is it on my right? -> Head down, smash it against the defender

82~~~
Agree with this. When your 300K a week Wayne and 40M Mata do nothing but play the ball out to him what can he do? We've known for a few seasons he isn't the same attacking player he was but yesterday he was one of the only players who actually looked like they wanted to make things happen.

83~~~
He was ok. Did well for the goal and generally defended quite well. Stupid formation (and enforced team formation) meant he was usually completely isolated and even less likely than usual to create anything.

84~~~
Imagine if he had technique and could marry his pace to it. Shame.

85~~~
Why does he seem to think that twatting the ball as hard as you can is what constitutes a cross?

86~~~
I'm beginning to despise Valencia. Horrendously shite player

87~~~
Why is he our most popular outlet? We can't wait to get it out to him so he can ruin the attack. It's maddening.

I'd rather he was anonymous, but he's the complete opposite. Always on the ball. Always doing exactly the same thing with it.

88~~~
This joker has been hiding under the radar for too long, id rather have a 20% fit Nani

89~~~
I'm pretty sure I hate him.

90~~~
Can someone please do a all touches of Valencia in this match? please

91~~~
Terrible player at the moment.

92~~~
He is defying every known logic to mankind every time he rams his cross into the defender.

93~~~
I'm convinced our demise began the day we replaced Cristiano Ronaldo with Antonio Valencia.

94~~~
Bang on.

95~~~
If Rafael is fit and doesn't get a game ahead of him LvG is an idiot.

96~~~
For 18 months he has been the consistently worst player I have ever seen for united. I don't care what went before. Opposition must rejoice when they see him in the team you literally have to stand near him to take him out of the game. Should be sold by Monday

97~~~
Really is a cancer to the attack. Did nothing right on the ball all game.

Sooner he's out the team the better.

98~~~
Gets the ball, crosses and hits the first man, or passes it out to a midfielder who gives it to the other winger. He continues to regress.

99~~~
Why is he still here??

100~~~
He's a joke of a player. I'd back myself to mark him out of a game.

101~~~
Ruins almost every attack by just smashing it against the defender or slowing things down, and 90% of our attacks go down his side. Young is better than him FFS.

102~~~
I groan whenever someone passes him the ball. Shouldn't be anywhere near the team.

103~~~
I think he only managed to get ball across past the first man once but then he hit the second man. The bit near the end when evans had the ball and was yelling at him to make the run and he just stood there. I don't actually have one positive about his game today.

104~~~
Gets the ball -> pings it down the byline -> gets to the ball first because of his pace -> tries a first time cross -> hits the defenders leg and it's out for a goal kick

Repeat that infinite times. Summary of every Valencia's game.

105~~~
He gets so much of the ball and does so little with it. Playing as a wing back just means he doesn't have anyone on the overlap which exaggerates that problem even more.

106~~~
I think it is absolutely criminal that we got 80 million for Ronaldo, and spent that on Valencia and Obertan (I think I'm missing someone else.) Valencia would have been a decent squad buy; nowhere near good enough to be a regular starter.

107~~~
He should just feck off. I really, really start to hate him now, he's so useless it's incredible. Destroys every single one of our moves, doesn't contribute anything in defence and collects a fat paycheck. Should be out of the club sooner than Cleverley and Young, it's disgusting.

Got a proper meltdown here, but can't stand this player anyymore.

108~~~
Hopefully next game if Rafael isn't fit we can stick Young at rwb and have either Blind or Shaw available on the left.

109~~~
Get him as far away from the club as humanly possible. He should never start another game for us. Ever.

110~~~
Crossing apparently means just punting it as hard as you can.

111~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/05/15/article-2144534-1317618D000005DC-825_306x483.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/05/15/article-2144534-1317618D000005DC-825_306x483.jpg"/> 

Hard to believe this was just two years ago.
Gone from Manchester Uniteds best player to one of the worst players in the entire league.
Absolutely shocking!

112~~~
Sad part is he looked like our best hope of creating something in the last 15 minutes.

113~~~
I seriously wouldn't be against splurging £30M on Coleman just so I never have to watch Valencia whack 20 balls off the shins of defenders ever again.

114~~~
He's one of the main reasons why the 352 needs to go away. He'll consistently play in this formation over someone like Januzaj.

115~~~
I would swap any Burnley winger for this steaming turd of a player.

116~~~
The guy must be pure magic on the training field to still get matches constantly.

117~~~
This is our only wide outlet with Young. A guy who can't do anything other than hit the first man. If he wasn't a big unit he wouldn't play.

I'm sick and tired of him having the whole of the flank in front of him free and instead of running forward to get on a knocked ball down the channel he just stands there. Young does the same thing.

118~~~
Atleast he wanted the ball and managed to control it without falling over.

Van Persie, Mata and Rooney were horrendous and worse than Valencia.

119~~~
He doesn't even try anything. He has absolutely no balls. If the ball dropped to him at 0-0 on the edge of the box in a Champions League final in the dying minutes he'd dribble away or knock it back to the keeper. It's never a case of him fancying something or making something happen. He's just doing the bare minimum - defend and try not to give the ball away in attack. He should be fecking ashamed of the number of times he resorts to winning a corner or just aimlessly abusing the defenders shins. Awful.

120~~~
Defending against Valencia is surely the easiest game a fullback will have this season. Track his run, stand slightly to his right and let him slam the ball at your shin, easy afternoon. It's a joke when Januzaj is on the bench behind Valencia and Young.

121~~~
True but sadly that the player who was willing to create the most was the one with the crappiest crossing technique in Europe.

122~~~
As much shit as Young gets, he looks world class compared to this guy. Why he still features in the starting XI is beyond me. He is athletic and fast, yes, but that's about it.

He can't dribble, pass, shoot, cross and now it also seems he has lost the ability to think. ALL he does is run in one direction and either pass it back/sideways or just just hoof it into a defender

123~~~
That same trick. Shift the ball a yard to the right then try to belt it into the box and hope for the best. Gah, so frustrating!

Thought he put in plenty of effort on the right flank, but end product has totally deserted him.

124~~~
Honestly would Bebe have been any worse?

I assume he won't get in the side once Rafa is fit again.

125~~~
Its not his fault. We bought him and he happily came here. Not sure what our financial situation was at the time or whether it was at the peak of Fergie's "no value in the market" mantra, but we should've been a bit more ambitious after Ronnie left.

126~~~
I remember feeling guilty when someone wished injury upon him and got bollocked for it.

127~~~
I'm beginning to hate the little twat. He's been woeful for two years now.

128~~~
Sad but true. All it took was one lengthy injury to turn him into complete shit it seems. Just shocking stuff from him today again.

129~~~
I thought he offered more going forward today that most.

130~~~
Ashley Young made 5 dribbles down the left.

Valencia made 5 tackles but beat a man 0 times.

That about sums up Antonio Valencia.

131~~~
They get it in congested parts of the pitch. Valencia is great at being found with the ball, but when he has it, he is awful.

He should be part of the clear out.

132~~~
What's almost as frustrating as Valencia himself is most commentators still remarking how good he is at beating his man and getting a cross in.

133~~~
I can take a wing back/full back that's defensively sound but not great going forward or fantastic going forward but average defensively. He is bad at both. All he has is pace and strength. He's in the wrong sport.

134~~~
He must be the easiest player to mark as a defender these days. Show him onto the left foot, wait for him to do a few spins, stand your ground and wait to get twatted by the ball.

Even when he actually gets past his man he doesn't cross for anyone in particular, but just puts it into the box. Not our only poor player today by any means, but unlike most of the others he's not even trying to do anything meaningful.

135~~~
He doesn't even have pace.

I mean yeh, when he doesnt have the ball he's quick. But with the ball at his feet he's a fecking slug. Has the brain of a slug as well.

136~~~
That applies to a lot more of the players. They must all look world class in training.

137~~~
The definition of either the word clueless or one-dimensional is Antonio Valencia. No creativity. No change in direction. No effort to beat a man. No accuracy on the crosses he does get in. Not United quality for 24 months now.

138~~~
Defensively he nearly cost us by playing a stupid pass in the first half. Attacking wise he won a few corners by walloping a few hit and hope crosses but wasted twice as many as well. Over all it was yet another poor performance from him.

139~~~
We need to move to a back four and shift him to RB until Rafael is fit. This would hopefully eliminate some of the uneasy play that we have with three at the back and it would put Valencia in a position where he his one decent aspect of his game can be utilized; his defensive energy.

140~~~
I'm not sure if this is too strong and just in the aftermath of the game, but I find his play completely cowardly at times. In a formation that needs width and when we're chasing the win, he cuts back inside laying nothing balls back to Evans wide, forty yards from goal, instead of having the courage to try and beat his man and make something happen. Happens time and time again.

Van Gaal can't sort out all the deficiencies in this squad in one window of course, but I'd be amazed if Valencia is still here in a year's time.

I hope Rafael is back for the QPR game.

141~~~
He was always one-dimensional, but it worked when he was able to use that dimension effectively to deliver for us. Since his crossing and accuracy went to shit, he's been useless and seems to keep on getting worse now.

142~~~
As harsh as the criticism in this thread is he was our 2nd best player today and it wasn't even close after that. Only him and Di Maria showed up for the game.

143~~~
It makes no fecking sense whatsoever how his crossing has went to shit. One of the mysteries of the century.

144~~~
I just want to scream at him.  Take on your fecking man. Whenever he does it often leads to a chance.  What on earth changed in his mind 2 years ago?

145~~~
Jones? Rooney was also better.

146~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's literally all what he does. And it's been happening week in week out for over 2 years now. Who knows, maybe he's actually playing brilliantly as Fergie, Moyes and LvG all seem to love him.

147~~~
2nd best?

Not a chance. He wouldn't start for Wigan in this form. Can't wait for Rafael to be back or for us to sign another RB. Get rid of this clown

148~~~
If he was in the championship not one prem team would look at buying him.

149~~~
Even in the 2 years he's been out of form he's sometimes played OK at RB or when he's got Rafael with him. Now he's playing WB he's double teamed which makes him useless mostly. Still think he's actually alright defensively but it's basically law of averages if he puts a good ball in now.

150~~~
Jones looked like a suicide waiting to happen all game long and Rooney was extremely poor. Its either him or Fletcher.

151~~~
Him being 2nd best is rather an indictment on the rest of the team than a commendation for him.

152~~~
He can injure a lot of defenders with his crosses/shots.

153~~~
He wouldn't look out of place in league 1.

154~~~
They were still better than Tony. That you named Fletcher is also shocking. Without Jones Blackett/Evans would have fecked everything. He was the one keeping the defense together a bit.

155~~~
More as in, we got the ball to him a shitload more than any other forward player and he did nothing with it other than smack the defender as hard as he could, or .. ?

It was his fecking job to make more happen and get the ball to our other forward players and he never did, not once.

He was awful, I wish the club would get rid, it boggles the mind how he's still here, quite frankly.

156~~~
Really confused as to how people would rather keep Valencia than Young. Both are shite but feck me, he offers absolutely nothing. When the best defence is "he's decent defensively", you know he's shit. We're Manchester United. We don't buy wingers because they can fecking defend.

157~~~
Absolutely fecking awful again. He should be nowhere near the team

158~~~
Why bash League 1. I doubt he'd get into any Sunday League side. He'd get hooked off asap.

159~~~
I don't think I can pick anyone out of that defense to have had a decent game. Even Blackett played so many 5-10 yard passes short that a team with a slightly better quality would have killed us from the left flank.

160~~~
Jesus wept, he was among the worst offenders out there today. He constantly received the ball in acres of space and then proceeded to do the square root of feck all with it. Other players looked equally ineffective because they received the ball in congested areas, so there are at least some mitigating circumstances for them. But to receive the ball in so much space as he did, and so frequently, and to do so little with it, is beyond criminal.

161~~~
I honestly cannot remember anyone playing this badly over such a long period of time for us and still start in 90% of matches. He genuinely is one of the biggest problems we have. The wingbacks are supposed to be the ones in the formation finding space yet he hasn't got the bollocks, the brains or the ability to do anything with it.

162~~~
Who else offered anything more though going forward?

Di Maria looks the part but only Valencia got on the ball and tried to do something even if it wasn't that good by means of end product

163~~~
Still better than just shooting/crossing balls against the opponents knee's/legs.

164~~~
So did the away fans who had to pay for this shit.

165~~~
Young was better going forward than Valencia was, that's for sure.

Offering something going forward isn't really the same as having the ball loads.

166~~~
Who else had acres of space and plenty of opportunities to take on their man? Burnley packed the centre  so there was no space for the central players. They were able to do this because Valencia was so shit (the formation does not help either).

167~~~
It's like teams want us to pass the ball to him because they know nothing will happen. That is how bad he is.

168~~~
Not sure I understand your post here, as that's exactly what he did.

169~~~
he's just so shit. woefully shit.

170~~~
Has regressed at a torresesque pace

171~~~
If LVG is going to continue using wingbacks, there is no way we can keep giving Valencia game time.  This squad is still stuck in the routine of getting the ball out wide to him instead of trying to break through the defense and it's certain that he'll hit a defender or it will go out for a corner/throw-in.  Should not be chosen for one minute over Januzaj when the latter can actually beat a man.

172~~~
What I'm trying to say is that what Jones did according to Wednesday at Stoke, is still better than what Valencia did.

173~~~
So frustrating watching defenders focus on only blocking the by line and a right foot cross. Amount of times he has cut back and the defender hasn't even tried to get in position to stop a left foot cross, giving him a second or two to actually do one. Yet he doesn't even try. I would settle for crap crosses from his left right now, just so defenders couldn't blatantly ignore it

174~~~
After every ridiculous hard low cross he gives, he looks as if he has done some great job or something, bench the lad !

175~~~
standard second half display. Got the ball out wide a lot, and smashed it into the fullbacks shins.

176~~~
Crock of shite. He only knows one way of playing and it's just not working.

177~~~
To put this in a simpler way, for better or worse if we were to score a goal, he'd have got the assist for sure.

178~~~
Would probably be di Maria.

179~~~
And that's exactly why we were never going to score.

180~~~
It feels like a punishment from God for our sins or something to still have to watch Valencia stinking up the place for United. He is beyond atrocious. I would pick any other first team wide player in the Premier League over him and I actually don't think I'm joking any more. Completely sick of it at this point. He was never exciting because he just did the same thing repeatedly, but at least he used to be effective. Now it is just truly painful. What's all the more annoying is that he is the outlet we play to most for some inexplicable reason, which probably partly explains why we don't ever look like scoring.

Disclaimer: Knee jerk meltdown after another poor show from United.

181~~~
I don't get it. Just sign a right back and have done with it.

182~~~
It's as if he doesn't think. Surely someone on our coaching staff must have told him to stop trying to drill in crosses every time he gets the ball. Doing it on the odd occasion is fine but it's so predictable and therefore easy to defend against.

183~~~
He will continue to do the same unless he gets someone overlapping.

184~~~
What can be said about Valencia that hasn't already? I give up.

185~~~
But just imagine how sore the ankles of the Burnley fullback are <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

186~~~
It's worrying when the opposition decides not to mark your winger. Burnley did it today, and the tactic worked to wonders. Disappointed that LVG didn't take him off.

187~~~
Why the hell do our front 3 not create chances in between themselves and just pass it sideways so much.

Agree Young and Valencia sucked but they aren't supposed to be the main creative outlets in this system.

188~~~
Of course not. I love the guy, but he's just not good enough.

189~~~
The most limited player ever to wear a United shirt, I'm starting think he has a bet before each game on how many times he can hit the fullback.

190~~~
He's absolutely horrible but what I dont get is why were our players insisting with giving him the ball with which he didnt have a clue what to do with it. 
Every attack ball goes to him and he either hits the Burnley player or makes a awful cross.

191~~~
Definitely got up and down the right side-and did the defensive work. But the crosses were horrific. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g316/ktemkin1/imagejpg1_zps72afdc26.jpg" src="http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g316/ktemkin1/imagejpg1_zps72afdc26.jpg"/>

192~~~
I have said it before and i will say it again, the first two players out of the door should have been Young and Valencia they offer nothing going forward and never will, they are just never to be going enough for Manchester United, And with them in the side we will never see a change in style of play and attractive football, i remember in the Moyes era we only started to play better when we played Kagawa and Mata together and one of these two didn't play. I don't know what LVG is up to but i am very disappointed that he let go Nani, and it seems like Kagawa and Welbeck will be next, they are sooo much better players than these two losers its unbelievable.

193~~~
Those crosses <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

194~~~
That's unfair to Young who looks a lot better going forward.

195~~~
I don't understand how this guy can't wrap his foot around a ball and cross. He earns £60-80k every week. Him and Anderson are luckier than billionaires, at least they work to get their money.

196~~~
Because thats been the easy pass for us since Ronaldo left. Valencia stays out wide which gives him space to receieve the ball. Defenders are happy enough with him getting the ball because he's simple to defend against so they dont get tight to him and cut out the pass

197~~~
The red arrow crosses <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

198~~~
Need Rafael fit asap

199~~~
He's absolutely brutal to watch these days. All a defender needs to prepare to face him is concentration, a good engine and strong shin pads. He's one of the biggest reasons we struggle to create anything because there's zero innovation in his game. He may be big, strong and fast but that counts for nothing at the highest level. For all his assets there isn't any penetration in his play. Too many of our attacks end with Valencia and it's mind boggling why we continue to persist.

200~~~
He's on a huge downward spiral. Linked to confidence in my opinion. He has lost confidence, he plays poorly, he loses more confidence, plays even worse, rinse and repeat this over the course of about 30 games and what your left with is a performance like today's.

Mentally he isn't up to playing for Manchester United. When he gave up the 7 shirt we should have known.... He can't handle the pressure. Needs to move elsewhere.

201~~~
He is a low priority problem for me. Nothing new here. We have Rafael to come back.

202~~~
Another thing i would like to add, people keep expecting Rooney, Rvp and Mata to create forget one thing, although they were soo poor today i wouldn't even try to defend them, but teams clog up their midfield and there is very little space given to them, on the other hand Valenica and Young are in acres of space and they do feck all with it, one keeps smacking it into Defenders and the other is a backpass specialist, and their crosses are hilariously bad.

203~~~
He's not on a downward spiral, he's pretty much at rock bottom. I don't know how he could get any worse. I thought we'd seen the end of him when LVG was appointed and then we go and bring in one of the best wingers on the planet and he still plays.

204~~~
Hopefully Rafael stays fit and takes up his place in the team. Valencia's terrible, a joke we've given him a new long term contract.

205~~~
From being a very good player 3 seasons ago, I would argue he is on a downward spiral. I get what you mean though but I wouldn't put it passed him to get even worse!

206~~~
he is useless.  Enough said.

207~~~
Get the ball, jog forward a bit, smash ball at defenders legs. Look angry. Rinse and repeat for 90 minutes.

He's an absolute disgrace of a player, and should have been one of the first out the door. Then again, no other team in the top 10 would want him anywhere near their squad.

208~~~
I get what you mean too, but I'm of the opinion that the downward spiral is over, he is what he is now. Shit for so long now and we need to get rid.

209~~~
We need a right footed Daley Blind who can play as a cm and if needed as a full back.

210~~~
A fit Rafael will force AV25 out of the team.

211~~~
Fighting for Cleverley for worst United first team player imo. He's been horrible for 3 years.

212~~~
him and young weren t any worse than the rest except perhapsdi maria

213~~~
Its amazing how he continues to put in performances like that and still retains his starting place, I mean all our other wingers at the club must be really bad if hes the best option we have there.

214~~~
Would Zaha have done any worse today? Instead of standing square to the full back and smashing it at his legs, he might have at least had a go at getting in behind. Valencia and Young just don't seem to have the guile to want to get behind a defender. Zaha is no world beater, but he does at least want to take a man on and get the ball into a dangerous area before playing it. As winger, you're more dangerous if you have the ball in the penalty area, with the full back taken out of the equation. If you're just wellying it into a packed penalty area right out on the touchline from infront of the opposing full back, there's little chance of scoring, especially since neither Valencia or Young can cross a ball anyway. Zaha gets a lot of flack for being a bit of a waster, and he most probably is a bit of a waster, but I can't fathom how a winger could be any more negative and ineffective than Valencia.

I can't imagine his team mates enjoy his approach either. If I'm a centre forward, I don't want the ball smashed at me like he's taking a shot and I'm the goal! It's difficult enough to attack a cross, but to attack a cross being belted at you at 100mph? It's a ridiculous idea.

215~~~
he s not the only one putting ccrap performances...

216~~~
This is pretty bang on for me I agree. We had numerous occasions today when our wide players had opportunities to run into space and get balls into the box and neither Young or Valencia managed to create a hint of a chance for 90 mins. When teams suffocate the middle of the pitch it can be extremely difficult to break any side down.

217~~~
Didnt say he was but given how we seem to play (get the ball to the winger as soon as possible) you would think putting someone else there might have been explored by now

218~~~
Yeah but... this is the Valencia thread.

219~~~
it s relatively a new role for him and young so you need to give them.time to adjust

220~~~
No, but the fact that he's still on the end of most of our attacks is going to draw far more attention to him. Amazing really, that despite the supposed attacking talent we have in the team, we still insist on channeling attacks through a player absolutely shattered in confidence, ability and everything else that goes with it.

221~~~
Given his performances last season and the season before as a winger and RB i am not holding out much hope

222~~~
Can anyone gif that moment pls... all.players were grouped around Burlney's box after our corner. Valencia receives the ball at halfline...and passes it back to DDG.

I died a little.

223~~~
One problem with our system is that it forces the wingbacks to try to beat two men from a standing start, with no overlapping runs to help.

That said, his crossing is an embarrassment. Hit and hope.

224~~~
LvG did too.

225~~~
Played better than Rooney and Van Persie to be fair. Not that that's anything to be proud of.

226~~~
Well no, he had more of the ball than they did. He didn't actually do anything useful with it though.

I mean if we had a semi competent winger in his place in the second half we might have actually won the thing, or, at the very least, got some fecking crosses in the box

227~~~
Offering him that contract extension in the summer is proving to be as foolish as giving Nani a 5 year one. I just dont see the point of him or what he brings to the team. There was a time where he could beat his fallback, get a dangerous cross in, provide good defensive cover and muscle players off the ball - But after the last 3 seasons that guy is gone and what we have is someone that represents whats wrong at our club today

228~~~
Both Rooney and Mata, twice, put him in an excellent crossing position inside the box only for him feck it up.

229~~~
Yeah i saw that :lo:

230~~~
Enough said and enough seen... Terrible player with no skills what so ever.. Pace and power only gets one so far..

231~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

232~~~
Thought he would be good as a wing back but he's not.  Not sure what happens next as his possible replacements are Rafael, injured, and Young, who is not much better.  Maybe a formation change, if we have a suitable right back.

233~~~
Gotta say, I don't think there is a similar player at a top league club. I mean how thick can you be to shoot in the fullback over and over again? What does he expect to happen? He isn't even trying to get it past him, he just hits the fecker...

234~~~
Really can't wait until Rafael returns. At least he adds some dynamism to our attack, whereas Valencia just runs in straight lines and punts it at the fullbacks shins.

We should see marked improvement once Rafael and Shaw replace Valencia and Young respectively.

235~~~
Why the feck did we give him a contract extension? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

236~~~
He's woeful. The next chance we get he should be shipped out along with young. How many times was he 1 on 1 with their full back, and how many times did he turn around and pass it back? He's a shocking footballer.

237~~~
I honestly cannot believe he's <i>still </i>doing the "smack it into the first defenders shins" thing.  Did it so many times (once again) that the commentators even mentioned it, which takes some doing!

At least it disproves the rather bizarre notion some in here had that Moyes had specifically told him to do it.

238~~~
It doesn't work but he still crosses like an idiot. When will he get it and why is no one telling him to stop ?

239~~~
What happened to him, from being our best player to a nothing player in one summer. I feel bad for him but he really has no place in the starting line up.

240~~~
It's depressing watching him. At times he worked hard, won possession, tracked back, but the lack of creativity is beyond a joke.

241~~~
Yep, the middle is too congested and we have little time on the ball so we end up working it well to Valencia who has time and space to do something but he just fires it hard into a defender time after time. You would hope he can be coached to pick out a team mate but this has gone on for far too long.

242~~~
The worst thing is when he actually waits for the defender to get back in position before crossing, it's like he's thinking 'I'm in space so I'd better slow down a bit if I want to put a great cross into the defenders shin again'.

243~~~
Possesses zero creativity. At least back couple years ago he made himself useful by running at the defenders and at least attempt to beat them by pace.

He's a deadwood at this stage and I don't see any benefit of keeping him.

244~~~
Commentators and pundits go so easy on him, although today by the end even Owen had to point out he was doing the same thing over and over. They said the defender had done a good job against him but he literally does the same thing every single time, it's not hard to defend against.

245~~~
One of the worst thing Lvg did was to give him a new contract. He's absolutely useless and infuriating to watch and should've been booted first out of the door in the clear out.

246~~~
Is he still doing that thing where he looks disappointed with himself after yet another failed cross? You're not fooling anyone, Antonio, least of all a sharp observer like me.
*puts cat in fridge, puts milk out for the night*

247~~~
Why is it even when he beats a man he just stops the ball dead and passes backwards. 

He is shocking.

248~~~
Was it Valencia that after a corner for us was cleared by Burnley to about the half way line turned and passed it all the way back to De Gea, home fans gave an ironic cheer and Van Gaal looked annoyed when the camera cut to him.

249~~~
Think that was Braveheart Evans, mate.

250~~~
He makes me scream obscenities, luckily I've developed a brain to mouth filter with age so they don't reach my lips but Christ he's terrible, seeing him on the same pitch with the quality of Di Maria was hugely telling. You can add in Ashley Young too, very poor footballers.

251~~~
"Performances"

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I lolled.

252~~~
Van Gaal's face was a picture when the camera cut to him straight after a corner was cleared to Valencia on the halfway line and he passed it all the way back to De Gea.

Not necessarily in that example, but if he isn't prepared to be braver in possession and take on his man, I think he will be out of this side as soon as Rafael is fit. His role is crucial in this formation and he's giving us very little going forward.

I think he's got to the by-line once in two games and we scored from it. That should tell him something. This drilling the cross straight at the defender is garbage.

253~~~
Currently watching Championship players put better crosses in than him.

254~~~
I have come to the conclusion that Antonio Valencia is absolutely brain-dead. I've thought this for a long time but when I see him keep making the same mistakes over and over again, then there is no other logical conclusion.

255~~~
His head is clearly broken. It takes 2-3 second for him to figure it out what to do next and he usually does the most obvious movement. FFS I ain't no footballer but I can predict his play 90% of the time. Never seen someone so consistently shite like him, under 3 fecking managers.

256~~~
By a country mile the worst player in our squad. Cleverley had more about him.

257~~~
The funny thing is? the great VG keeps picking him, strange, who really is in control? lol

258~~~
One dimensional, one footed, shot shy, lazy and gutless.

259~~~
He's a big part of the reason why we've been so hard to watch these days. I can't believe that he's been in favour of three managers now solely for the fact that he can do a shift defensively. Moyes liked that, fair enough, but now LVG? I hope to God he doesn't get near the first team when Rafael returns and is out the door by the time he gets injured again(cross the fingers he doesn't.)

He's toxic.

260~~~
Def has the management under some voodoo curse.

261~~~
There are a lot of great one-footed players from Maradona to Giggs but they could weave in and out through players with the greatest of ease.
Valencia, however, is so predictable he cannot be effective as a winger/ crosser. He should convert to a Right back.
He has two options. Fake going down the line before going full speed down the line or fake going down the line before cutting back and passing inside or backwards with his right foot. He must be easy to defend against.
For such a one-footed guy with average dribbling skills he should have used one of his off seasons to cultivate a Left foot.

262~~~
Unfortunately it was in fact Valencia who did that ridiculous pass.

263~~~
Damn, he's even worse than I thought...

264~~~
He used to be a fullback's nightmare, now he's their day off, I'd love a nice surprise of him being sold to Hull on deadline day.

265~~~
I thought RWB would be ideal for Tony V. He's not amazing going forward but was plenty good enough for a defender. Likewise, he used to work hard tracking back as a winger. Hence ideal Wing Back!

Turns out we just get the shittest of both worlds.

266~~~
Giggs is to blame here. He had the chance to tell LvG that Valaencia is shite, just get rid of him but no no we rewarded him new contract.

267~~~
"I like Valencia's pace"

268~~~
Exactly

How many times does he get to the point of delivery and GRRRRR he has to go back to right foot.

I've had enough of him

Use the left foot for god's sake.

It might be shit but AT LEAST A BALL COMES IN.

269~~~
Does LvG really have a choice but to pick him? No one else right now is fit and capable of doing the shift in his position. As awful as he has been he is about the only right sided player who can do defensive job that we have.

270~~~

271~~~
I just searched his Twitter handle to see what people are saying about him.

Wow.

272~~~
People will abuse someone who plays gutless it seems

273~~~
I don't think he's a lazy player. Many a times he's the one sprinting back on defense to nick the ball of the opponents forwards or midfielders and does a pretty good job disrupting play.

I agree with the rest though. The worst is the crosses on the ground. He's so lucky his ground cross against Sunderland resulted in a Mata goal because otherwise I cannot remember the last time one of his ground crosses actually worked. Van Persie against chelsea last year? Heck, I wonder if Mata didn't score that goal he would still be crossing it into the ground...

274~~~
I wouldn't even consider his outings as 'Performances' because that actually means he's performing tasks given to him which he clearly isn't. The fact that we gave him a renewal is a travesty. Now he will be difficult to get rid off. He is only still around because we have other areas that need fixing in the current window.

275~~~
In a match where he several times saved our defenders - he is being criticized for weak crosses. Despite the fact that the 2-3 times he managed to get the ball into the box - there were like 7 defenders and 1 United-attack there. That seems justified. 

Have you considered the fact - that maybe the lack of United-players in the box affects the way he crosses the ball ?

276~~~
I just wonder if you have been watching him over the last 2 seasons because his crossing hasn't exactly gone suddenly to shit.Its been a steady decline. Besides its just not his crossing alone that is being criticized. He's afraid to take players on and defenders don't consider him to be a threat at all.

277~~~
He's not a lazy player, just gutless and brainless.

Not a very potent combination as it turns out.

278~~~
Are you related to him perchance? he's utter dog turd. One of the shittest players in the Premiership and has been for some time now.

279~~~
He doesnt have a choice given our injuries.

280~~~
He's gone. Mentally. Plus his lack of variety has been sussed out by everyone and his inability to add more to his game has been the unmaking of him. I'd actually sell him before I sell Cleverley. (And I'm not opposed to selling Cleverley.)

281~~~
The lack of United players and the massed defenders in the box, combined with two opposition players closing him down and not a single overlapping run from anyone in white. You couldn't create a worse situation for our wide men if you tried. Oh actually you could, give them more defensive duties than usual. Yay for the 352!

Obviously, Valencia hasn't shined individually in any other formation for a while but the combination with Rafael has looked decent at times. So far this season Valencia has done a shitload of good defensive work and created our only competitive goal in open play, despite being absolutely crippled by this goddam formation we're playing. The abuse in this thread is (as ever) completely over the top.

282~~~
You guys are taking the piss, there is literally no LB who would like to play against him.

<span style="color: #ffffff">He would be blasting their legs.</span>

283~~~
There was one moment in the second half when mata i guess slid him into the right flank and their LB was left behind, he had acres of space and time to cross the ball he could have taken two touches before crossing it in and when he crossed it and it went out of play, i wanted to bang my head on the wall after that cross, before that atleast he had an excuse that he had a defender on him while he kept repeating that stupid predictable moving the ball on the left side and smashing it into the defender's shins.

284~~~
Janazaj is available

285~~~
What used to make Valencia a good option on the right - He would take the ball and run at his fullback, get past him with power and pace and put a ball into the box that the striker could get on the end of. At first these balls weren't that good, often behind the striker but it still made a chance for the team and the stats showed that he created more oppertunities from the right than anyone else in the league, so just the sheer number of balls that a striker could possibly turn in was what made him a good right winger. In his best season he finally refined his crosses and he wasnt putting a lot of them behind the striker where the chances was more difficult than it should have been, he was putting in some peaches that were very easy to turn in and his delivery was probably as good as anyone in the league at that time.

The current Valencia? He does none of these things. This weekend he beat his man 0 times. 0.

He attempted 12 crosses, allowing a striker to get an effort of some description away 0 times. 0.

All he really did is tackle 5 times, which tends to be all he does these days. Makes a bunch of tackles but isnt good enough defensively to be a defender. He's a crap rightback playing right wing.

286~~~
The funny thing about him. Most pundits and some opposition fans still think he is great.

287~~~
I just don't get it. I re-watched a video of his exploits in the 2011/2012 season and he was an absolute beast. Everyone knew what he was going to do, but he simply ran past players with immense pace. His crossing has arguably never been world class, but at least he used to vary it with low and lofted crosses. He also varied his runs more in that he cut inside the players more. Sometimes I wish that LvG would force him to do this by actually play him on the left; sure he would be even easier to read, but he would be forced to do something different - Robben didn't use his right leg to save a drowning kitten, so why not...

Valencia hasn't lost pace either... weird it is

288~~~
I do want to shake him at times, it's like he waits for the marker to come to him and close down the angle before he tries to cross the ball. It's very infuriating at times because he has the potent is to be unstoppable particularly in that 2011-12 season when he came back from that horrific injury he was amazing. Since then he seemed to have regressed. I do like him but I want to strangle him sometimes.

289~~~
The only thing he ever had was pace and power. He's always been unintelligent, limited and incredibly one dimensional, but I heard he makes us solid, "puts in a shift" and helps out in defence, so let's give him a pass. It's absurd that most of you are just realizing he's shit, he's been shit for a long time now, never rated him. Pub standard player at best.

290~~~
What baffles me the most is how many times Mata was there at the edge of the box asking for the ball to play some combination with him and Valencia just ignored him time and time again and kept smashing the ball into defenders legs. I have no idea if he really is that stupid, but he looks like he has no brain whatsoever. He literally represents everything that is wrong with this team in last two seasons.

291~~~
I do think he's lost some pace actually, we rarely if ever see him leave someone for dead anymore once past them even if he's still one of if not the fastest player we have.

292~~~
I could be wrong but I seem to remember someone posted a video analysis showing he hadn't lost any pace even over the first yard.

Important to note - as many posters already have - that the last time he was 'good' was when Paul fracking Scholes was hitting him in stride with forty yard passes, with the opposition left back off balance and scrambling to get into position.  A far cry from the past two/three years of our current midfielders merely pushing the ball out wide to him with two banks of four already set.

293~~~
Even when he gets into a decent position his crossing is absolutely woeful. Thats the real regression imo.

294~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> you haven't been on the caf for a long time now have you ?

295~~~
Being one-dimensional isn't necessarily a negative thing, especially in Valencia's case since he combined four crucial elements of his play - intelligence, speed, great engine, and good crosser - and made himself a very useful outlet for us. But it seems like he's lost most of that.

The point about the system being a hindrance for him is a good point because we all know that he's lost the ability to run at his man with conviction and relies more on our right back to overlap and provide him with space. However, you can't blame the system for his atrocious deliveries. There are occasions where he finds space but then delays his cross which I don't quite understand. Or other occasions where he's in space and crosses it first time, but it's a mediocre delivery. It's definitely something that can be improved, but there has been no improvement for two years now.

296~~~
Depends how long haha, but i keep hearing that he makes us solid, tracks back, plays better with Rafael and bullshit lines like that.

297~~~
You can't be serious! He's not an intelligent player. There's this misconception here that because he keeps the ball more, then he's intelligent. He's not. He's just a cowardly player who is too scared to make a mistake, so, rather than try to beat his man, he'll pass back and play it safe. We'' retain the ball, but never hurt the opposition. I'm sure that's why you think he's intelligent. There's nothing intelligent about beating your man with pace and whipping in a cross.

298~~~
Well in the post you quoted, I wasn't talking about the current Valencia because he's not an intelligent player, but I was referring to the "old Valencia" who was unarguably an intelligent player for us IMO. He wouldn't dwell on the ball to the degree we see now and would take on his full back with conviction and put in a good cross. He would also cut in, but that seems to have completely disappeared out of his game (last seen against Aston Villa away 13/14).

299~~~
You want to play him as a wing back?

300~~~
No just go to 4 at the back

301~~~
He didn't do it before, that's the thing! One of his strengths was choosing the right crossing technique and target in the box. Nowadays he just smashes it in without looking. 

I don't get it. He's also completely lost the ability to go past his man.

302~~~
He's been like this for over two years now. Funny how even up until recently people were constantly saying "it's just a dip in form" to make excuses for their beloved winger. It must be the longest dip ever.

The worst thing with Valencia is that there was nothing gradual about his decline, or any injuries involved. He literally went from flat out being our POTY to being absolutely dire as soon as he threw the #7 on next season, and has been awful ever since.  Just bizarre really.

303~~~
Things will only start to improve once he's gone in my opinion. He is literally everyone's go to outball and he constantly produces nothing with it. It won't be until we remove the option of passing to him that we start to look better and have to try new things. With Valencia on the pitch it's too easy to pass him the ball.

304~~~
The absolute worst thing is, he gets applauded for consistently winning corners from great attacking positions. wtf?

305~~~
That could be a long time, considering we have given him a new contract

306~~~
Pony con solo uno trickito. Found out long ago and can no longer be counted on for any real threat going forward.

307~~~
Who'd have played RB then? Jones? We'd have a half fit Evans and Blackett as the 2 CBs then.

308~~~
I would use valencia at RB, he is solid, works hard, he can be that extra man someone like janazaj or di maria can use to overlap, much like how beckham and neville use to do down our right hand side. If VG is using valencia at RB, why not see how he can be used at RB, I actually think that is where valencia's future could lie, has a fullback more than a wingback, which that position I still feel is too much like playing at RW

309~~~
What's really bizarre is that every now and then (like once in 10 games or something) he'll do something decent, like actually run at a full-back, beat him, put in a cross and we'll score (see Sunderland), but then after that, he will flat out refuse to do anything of the sort again in that game, instead opting for that wonderful 5 yard backwards/sideways pass (see the rest of the Sunderland game) or any of the following games... seemingly content with that one run he did and thinking it'll serve him for the near future.

310~~~
He did play RB last season and was dire there as well. Its shitness isnt due to the new system.

311~~~
That is where he could be effective if he is played at fullback, someone like di maria or janazaj could carry the attack and all valencia has to do is overlap, makes his job easier and he could be an effective weapon on that front

312~~~
Who wasn't shit last season? I do not think we had the wingers, under someone like VG and with di maria signed he could be better.

313~~~
It could be, but he flat out refuses to do it at times... despite it working in that very same game, it's completely baffling.

314~~~
He was terrible before we became terrible. If anything players like Valencia were a sign of things to come

315~~~
Not just last season, the season before that too. He's hit rock bottom and stayed there for a while now. If we have to play wingers, Januzaj would be a much much better option. The guy cant beat a man, cant cross, cant shoot.

316~~~
Renewing his contract is one of the biggest mistakes ever made.

317~~~
Tony V has one move in his locker and fullbacks figured him out a long, long time ago.

Useful squad man?  Sure.  But he grinds our game down when he's got the ball.

318~~~
The question is? why did the club give him a new contract, he has been so terrible, yet the club extends his contract

319~~~
Giggsy you mean? Sentimentality. He played Rio and Vida in pretty much every game he managed too.

320~~~
It just frustrates me how he is continued to be played, and I do not even want to get started with ashley young fletcher and the coaching staff continuing to think cement feet trio of mata rooney and RVP will work, when our wingbacks are young and valencia

321~~~
It all depends on how fit Rafael can stay, no way does Valencia get picked over a fit Rafael. Ditto with Young and Shaw. Fletch too with us getting Blind and when carrick gets fit again.

322~~~
I still think our best system is 4231, and dropping either mata rooney and RVP. If by miracle everyone is fit, the team defiantly should look like this

DDG
rafeal jones rojo shaw
carrick herrera
di maria mata janazaj
rooney/RVP

Blind still think he is more of a squad player

323~~~
Exactly what I think too, it is crazy how he's let this aspect of his game get that worse without trying to change things. I bet he believes that smashing it increases his chances of "creating" danger. That's retarded IMO.

324~~~
Do players have annual performance reviews?

If I failed to improve on several things at the job over a span of 2/3 years i'd be sacked, and rightly so.

325~~~
Where as Valencia got rewarded with a new contract. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

326~~~
We do. He had one end of last season and Giggsy decided to hand him a shiny new contract.

327~~~
It was Giggs? I know that Giggs was said to have told Rio that if he was manager he'd be our main man at the back this season.

328~~~
Giggs didn't make that decision.

329~~~
Redknapp claimed that iirc. Wont be surprised if it was true though, he played him every game when he was in charge.

He was the manager at the time and if I'm not mistaken even commented on how busy he was with preseason planning and contracts for players.

330~~~
Valencia signed a new contract in mid June. Van Gaal was manager.

331~~~
He was nowhere near the club at the time, Giggsy was his man at the club then. Ofcourse, there's no way one can say this for sure but with giggsy being the AM and the interim manager before that and Van Gaal busy with the WC, it has to be Giggsy's call not Van Gaals imo.

332~~~
And by that time Valencia wasn't a player that needed to be assessed or watched live to see his level. He was a confirmed poor player.

333~~~
So what if he wasn't near the club? He wanted Evra to stay and didn't want Rio.

334~~~
So he gets advice about the current players by the man already at the club who happens to be his assistant manager.

335~~~
You know Giggs wanted Rio to stay right. So by that logic LVG would have given him a new contract too.

336~~~
No because unlike Valencia, Rio was a no brainer. I'm not saying Giggsy made either call on his own, ofcourse it was discussed between the 2. Giggsy would have asked for both to stay, Van Gaal agreed regarding Valencia and not about Rio.

337~~~
Who made the call in the end? 

Giggs or LVG? LVG, so stop blaming Giggs.

338~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Okay Ryan.

339~~~
Not necessarily gone, but have our most creative players as top priority rather than him be the main man in constructing attacks which is also down to Mata, Rooney, and Van Persie playing poorly. Historically we use the right wing more than the left wing, and most of the time there's been nothing wrong with that. But surely Moyes should have identified the problem early on and changed our approach. Van Gaal recognised the problem as soon as he arrived, and playing Valencia is down to us lacking options (Rafael injured) and players not being of the right profile (Nani, Januzaj, and Zaha) to play in a role that requires you to be very solid defensively. But then... is Valencia viable enough defensively?

340~~~
As was Nani, Rooney etc etc

341~~~
Would agree with this except I'd have Evans in place of Rojo, and think this system allows us to use Welbeck a lot more as he could provide cover for the wide role and play in place of Januzaj in some of the games.

342~~~
But I get the sense even if everyone is fit he will stick to 352, which is a worry with his reign, that his stubbornness in not playing a system that gets the best out out most creative players, just because he cannot drop the main 3, who have been terrible

343~~~
wanted by Juve in January according to the Express (I know). Would be good business for both parties if true.

344~~~
As long as they don't expect to get him on loan. If we can jettison Valencia, Young and Fellaini in January and bring in Strootman that would be another good window for us.

345~~~
Juve just love buying our players.

346~~~
LVG probably made the call on Giggs's advice as his assistant manager. The same way he sanctioned the Herrera and Shaw deals despite them not being his targets. He trusted the club's judgement on those two transfer and Gigg's judgement on Valencia which was wrong imo. 

What we know is this. Valencia was allegedly getting linked to certain clubs(Liverpool I think??) as his contract was running out and we handed out an extension without LVG being able to judge him first-hand. That was probably done upon consultation with Giggs who was his go-to guy as assistant manager, for information on the existing United's squad. After judging him at close quarters, LVG clearly didn't rate him as a good winger. He was kind of meh in pre-season and got injured towards the end as well. He made a statement about the team lacking quality wingers which was a damning appraisal on the ability of Valencia, Nani, Young and Zaha. In ideal circumstance, we would have probably off-loaded him alongside Nani and Zaha and gotten a younger right-back as specialist cover for the injury-prone Rafael. However, due to the long-term contract that Valencia handed out, we are now stuck with him as our cover for Rafael.

347~~~
i think he'll benefit from the new players we've bought and he will have a decent season unless hes sold in jan.

348~~~
Absolute waste of space

349~~~
He's playing with no intelligence whatsoever. He's not using his brain to be a better asset to the team on the pitch. Just driving crosses in like a machine.

350~~~
I think when everyone's fit, he'll be consigned to being a benchwarmer. That said, relying on Rafa to be fit for prolonged periods is more foolish than relying Valencia to get a single cross right in a game.

351~~~
Valencia is a curious case. Was it really his injury that did him or something else?

I find it amazing how he suddenly declined from being one of the best wingers in the league to nothing. He progressed at the same rate from Wigan though in fairness. It was like the Wall Street Crash.

352~~~
Very simple - one trick pony got found out. Defenders learned to show him onto his left and never give him the chance to get into the space behind them and that's his entire skillset nullified.

353~~~
Do you really think that? I am not having it. That doesn't explain his unwillingness to run at/past people or even find a simple cross, all things he was doing consistently well previously.

354~~~
It's very easy to counter him because the defender knows exactly what's going to happen. If positioned correctly, it's very hard for Valencia to get a run at the fullback. That's why most players have at least several plays in their book. Unfortunately Valencia only has one, and unless that one move is absolutely unbeatable, you're going to get found out at the top level.

355~~~
He's a bloody coward. What we're left with now is a shell of a once effective winger. Will he try take on a man? No. Can he whip a cross around the fulllback? Can he fcuk. Can he come inside on his left? Impossible. Does he have have pace? Yes but only without the ball but when he receives it he turns into a bumbling one paced wreck. Technical ability? None. He would not start on the Everton side nevermind any of the "big guns", thieving a living he is.

356~~~
I don't buy the whole one trick pony stuff. He still had no fecking left foot even in his prime, and it's not like it's was a secret. No way someone like Ashley Cole would get destroyed because he simply forgot to show him inside. The biggest thing about Valencia is that he's lost his set of balls. He used to make plenty of surges on the inside of the fullback to give some variance and he'd only slow down to use the fullback as a decoy run. He'd isolate the full back and attack him immediately and would actually have an idea of what he wanted to do with the ball. Now he hesitates, looks for any easy option and if that fails plays the percentage ball, normally trying to win a corner or send a generic ball into the box.

357~~~
Yes, 100%.

He's known for two things:

1 Turn back Tony. The outside of the foot 270* turn to pass it back to his fullback or centre back.

2. Drilling the ball into the defenders legs.

Both of which are down to the the fact that he can't beat his man anymore because defending against him is painting by numbers, position yourself well, show him onto his left and he's beaten.

His latest consistent fail is trying to float the ball in without beating his fullback. He stands there doing his little chicken leg "am I going to kick the ball this time or keep standing here" and drop shoulder thing a couple of times before just opting to float the ball into the box. It's usually long or drifting away from goal and due to the nature of the build up to the cross, the defence isn't stretched, no space created and the strikers haven't got a scooby doo where or when to time there run.

358~~~
Nah, I don't buy it. He's always been a one trick pony. 

You're not telling me it took defenders 3+ years to figure out what that one trick was. He was just bloody brilliant at it and full backs couldn't do a thing.

He's just become shit for whatever reason.

359~~~
Can someone tell me what he's actually good at? What does he actually bring to the side cos I can't see anything.

360~~~
Agree but sub "whatever reason" with confidence. One trick ponies CAN be effective.

361~~~
Really couldn't beat his man to save his life these days. Just frustrating to watch.

362~~~
Young is a good cover for both Wing backs and any win position, he stays simply because he can still play a bit and is versatile enough. Valencia can only play on one side of the pitch and is terrible on that side.

363~~~
Absolutely. Fergie had a knack of getting the most out of pretty limited players by making them work with the team. There was a spell where every single game Valencia tortured the opposition left back, he was an animal.

364~~~
I remember towards the end of his best season he even started varying him game by coming inside and linking up with the striker and then go outside again. Welbeck was pretty usefull at this interplay. I have no idea what happened to that development because the following season it died.

365~~~
Agree with you. He was always found out, but that wasn't enough. Against Blackburn, they put both Olsson brothers on him trying to nullify his pace, but as their manager said afterwards, it just wasn't enough. He outrun them and outmuscled them time and time again, and that's what he pretty much did to every fullback.

He's just as fast these days, just look at some of his defensive runs, and he still gets past players from time to time, but then he stops before crossing, letting the defender make a sliding tackle to clear the ball.

I have no idea what it is that is limiting him because all the attributes that he once had are still there. People talk about him losing pace after that injury, but that run against Liverpool was after the injury and he is still time and time again quoted as being faster than both Bale and Ronaldo (which I don't find that hard to believe). It was Rooney who said that the one thing he would want from another player was Valencia's pace... Use it!

366~~~
Ya it's a strange one. His best season was in 2011/12 which was after his injury so I don't think that had anything to do with his decline. He was without doubt the most one dimensional player I can remember us having in recent years. It always confused me how defenders couldn't stop him as you knew what he was going to do every time. Even at his peak it was always just about knocking the ball past the full back and whipping the ball in. It was so effective though. For some reason he simply refuses to take players on nowadays and his crossing, which was once excellent, now involves hitting the ball off the ankle of the full back over and over each game. Arguably our must frustrating player as unlike others he actually used to be very good.

367~~~
Hopefully we wont be using wingbacks much longer and will add another quality wide forward so Young can move on.

368~~~
Unbelievable we let kagawa leave, yet Valencia and young are still here. feck me.

to think he was called one of the best wingers in the world by guardiola a few years back, christ.

369~~~
TV has been dire but he's still a useful squad man for us.  Nuke Ashley, hold Tony.

370~~~
I wonder how many years he will have to be dreadful for people to stop saying this.

371~~~
Yeah I actually think he lost a yard of pace which has effected his confidence and made his "1 trick" a lot less damaging.

372~~~
When did he lose this pace then? It was clearly not after his damage as proven by that run against Liverpool and him having a terrific season afterwards, and why should he lose pace now? He was recently quoted by FIFA as the fastest player in Europe and his defensive runs seem to support that. Last season he easily outpaced Sterling for the ball for instance. He takes too long on the ball though - much too long.

373~~~
I don't believe his injury has anything to do with his decline. He returned from that nasty leg break, finished off the season looking pretty good, then went on to have an explosive season the year after, winning the Matt Busby and the Players' Player awards, deservedly.

It's a mystery as to why he's not effective anymore. He's definitely still lightning quick. I don't buy all that "defenders have figured him out" lark either. Did these defenders not watch his 4 seasons at Wigan where he did the same thing? Every time he got the ball, you knew what he was going to do. Even when doubled up on, he still created space with his pace, and got the ball behind the defence. Unless you can figure out a way to run faster than him, you couldn't really stop him.

Now he dwells, and doesn't seem to know what he's going to do.

I don't think he's lost any pace, but perhaps he has lost that insane burst of acceleration which allowed him to change pace so quickly. I haven't seen him draw a defender in and then just burst past him like he used to do for such a long time. The pace is still there, but it was how quickly he could hit top speed which made him so dangerous. Does he still have that at his disposal?

374~~~
What he's lost is his acceleration and not his top speed, kind of like Wayne Rooney who still has a good top speed too. Previously he beat people on will just by accelerating away from them the first step and these days he never accelerates as quickly. 

You can clearly see he has a brutal top speed still when he gets a chance to use it. Unfortunately having a great acceleration is much more important than the quite irrelevant top speed factor - which you only get to see a couple of times per season.

375~~~
I agreed with this up until some point last season, since he was at one point a very useful winger for us and was a handy player to have. I've gotten to the point now though where I just don't see him replicating his 2011/2012 form again and being a good winger for us.

376~~~
Sorry for late response mate.

Maybes he's lost acceleration and not necessarily top speed?

377~~~
Maybe, and you may very well be right here, but that doesn't explain why he just doesn't run at defenders at top speed anymore. In the past, he used to run at players and flick it on the outside at pace leaving defenders for dead. Nani was always quicker off the mark, imo, than Valencia is. So many times Valencia has been isolated against his fullback with the option to simply flick the ball twenty yards ahead and run past his opponents, at pace even, yet he refuses to try this. That is what I cannot understand. Valencia never had quick feet the way Lennon or Sterling has, but he would destroy both for top speed over a distance. In close quarters he was never the best, but he's lost the ability to run at people...

No worries mate - I'm hopeless that way myself<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

378~~~
I agree about Nani, his first few step or two were always brilliant. I think Valencia lost his acceleration and with that he lost his confidence. Currently he looks too self aware, knowing that he won't beat his man so he doesn't even try when he has a good shot at it. 

I think that off the ball he still shows his great pace at times, but even when he does at least in my eyes he doesn't have that world class acceleration anymore. At his peak his top speed and acceleration was enough to consistently ridicule full backs with the same move, over and over. 

These days I think he looks a bit sluggish even, in terms of his first two steps. I think as Valencia relied on his physical attributes more than probably any footballer before, he just went straight down hill after losing the acceleration he built his game on. 

I am still amazed that he went so far in football without a functional left foot.

379~~~
And he's stopped trying to be accurate with his crosses. It's like in his mind he says "why bother ?"

380~~~
Nani was a joy at his peak - such quick movements and unpredictability. 

I don't think I've seen Valencia try to accelerate past players in ages, so I can't say that I have noticed if he is sluggish or not, but he does look a bit heavy whilst running at "slower" speeds, and he's about as agile as a rhino. Even if he has lost acceleration, which I don't think he has tbh, it doesn't explain why he never runst at his opposition anymore. Look at the run he had against Liverpool and the speed at which he carried the ball - I think Kyle Walker would get a run for his money (saw Valencia outpace him too in the middle of the park last season). Even against really sluggish fullbacks he never tries to run past anymore - it has to be more than just pace. I really makes no sense. Why he stopped varying his crosses also baffles me; before he used to smack them at times, or make proper aerial crosses and then drive the next for a shot on the 18 yard box. Now it's like he doesn't believe that his feet can do more than one angle, bizarre...

381~~~
I wonder if anybody has taken him aside in regards to his crossing? His crossing is absolutely terrible and has been absolutely terrible for about 2 years now. Either it's a problem nobody is willing to address or he's just ignoring any advice. I just cannot understand how he keeps getting away with blasting the ball into the shins of the left back or if it does beat the defender it's high and wide and crap.

The fact he recently signed a new contract is just baffling to me. Everyone goes through slumps, but this is now a 2 year slump with no end in sight.

382~~~
It is crazy to something like this can happen at this level tbh. You don't lose your crossing ability unless you deliberately change it.

383~~~
Agreed about Nani. Was actually 1 of my favourite players while here at united. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

384~~~
It's mental. He is one of the fittest players in the squad and still had speed and acceleration despite the injury. What he needs and what we don't have it seems is a sports psychologist like the scousers brought in last year. One may have helped Nani too after the carragher assault. The #7 fiasco was a sign of that.

385~~~
He's a disgrace. Can't stand him.

386~~~
Can i just say, Kudos to whoever did the Quotation marks on "performances". Genuine Kek

387~~~
I can understand fans having different opinions on players, that's normal but to call him a disgrace is just stupid in my opinion. He has been a great pro for United and is not a disgrace.

388~~~
Having a break from international football apparently.

389~~~
In his one fantastic season for us it was 100% going full speed down the touchline and 100% crossing into the box, mostly for Rooney. 

I don't know if losing a step of pace has killed that, but there seems to be as lot of hesitation in his game, a lot of over-thinking.

Though recently in some of our zombie football days, where the plan seemed to be 'give it to Valencia then stand there', he was still usually the outlet for the back line to feed the ball into the offense and one of the few who could beat a man.

390~~~
Likeable bloke, a pro, and had a beast of a season a few years ago. 

Painful to watch now though, incredibly predictable, slows the game down, boring, pretty much epitomises everything bad about our football in the past few seasons.

391~~~
Wow! He's the one who sacked his manager because he wanted to stay at this club and he gives his all, even if he plays below average. You would probably say that you are a great united supporter, but by saying what you did there, I probably would argue that you are a bit of a disgrace, truth be told.

392~~~
Spot on - there is no easy way to logically explain what happened. Even if he had lost some of his pace, it still doesn't explain why he doesn't run into open spaces when no defenders are around. He stops, over-thinks and then passes sideways or backwards. It really is bizarre.

393~~~
He should take a break from club football instead <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

394~~~
There's one thing not being good enough. As long as your trying eveything in your power to contribute. And I'm sorry, but Valencia doesn't even try anymore. He's completly gone into his shell, and rather then at least trying to produce something, to beat a man, to whip in a cross, he just does the bare minimal possible. Unless you call just constantly smashing the ball at the defenders legs trying. And that is why he is a disgrace. 

He is anything but a great pro, or a player that gives his all. In fact he's the complete opposite. He's a joke.

395~~~
I can't really think of Valencia as a player who wouldn't try to play better if he could. He's definitely a hardworker, he just doesn't have the talent to influence the team in the way we want him to.

I personally love playing team-sports, and I sure as hell want to improve myself whenever I can in my current team. But I also realise that there's a glass-ceiling, whereby I just lack a certain amount of match awareness, that speed/agility and split-second decision making that would make me a better player. My head sometimes processes movements that my body just can't react to, such as wanting to make that certain pass to another person but lacking the foresight to have positioned my body in such a way to actually make the pass in time, or even wanting to make a certain type of move that my legs and arms just can't make. Perhaps I'm not that athletically gifted as others, or have the same level of spatial-awareness that others have, but that doesn't mean I don't try my best.

I often opt for the safer pass not because I'm a coward, but because the "time" has already passed for me to make the "riskier" pass, whereby the opponent has come into a point where he has a 50/50 chance of intercepting whereas such a pass would have been viable just half a second ago. In team sports, one of the worst things that can happen is you making a unnecessarily risky pass and leaving your team to get countered. The defence would be all over the place trying to get back into whatever marking system you have set yourself, and you'll be the ultimate player to blame. Players like Mata/Di Maria are ones who can make the "risky" pass into sufficient risk, which is why they are so high in demand and value. You learn to read situations like that, and I think Valencia has just lost that "bit" of an advantage over the opponent where he can do riskier options with enough safety net to actually do it. Whether if it's pace, agility or just match-thinking speed, all I know is that he has somehow regressed from the previous seasons to what we're seeing from him now.

I don't blame Valencia for being chosen into the team, I just think that he's not good enough for the team we need.

396~~~
He's the definition of a coward.

397~~~
Basically this.

398~~~
I hope it's not to prolong his club career.

399~~~
He's not a joke and probably one of our players who run the most during matches, but he looks to have lost any clue what to do with the ball in attack. That's not a disagrace per se, it's just not good enough. Quite a difference.

400~~~
He doesn't even try anything, thats why he's a disgrace. As someone above said, he's a coward.

401~~~
I agree with the coward bit - but from that to disgrace is quite a stretch. I've not defended him one bit, but he genuinely looks like he cares and he certainly puts in a shift and isn't afraid to tackle either. That's not a disgraceful player, it's one lacking in either quality or belief in himself - or both.

402~~~
I am not a fan of his but calling him a coward and disgrace is simply cruel. The man just has limitations. I remember at the start of one recent season he actually passed the ball a couple times with his Left foot. The pressure of playing for is maybe too much for him and so he tries to not make mistakes rather than be adventurous, a safety first approach.

403~~~
Being a coward is disgraceful at a club like United imho. As I say, I could forgive him if he was trying things and they just weren't coming off, but not even attempting anything out of his comfort zone is unforgivable.  He's also developed this annoying  habit of losing the ball in dangerous situations, and then standing there with a look of 'I couldn't give a feck' across his face.

Look, I used to love Val, but these past few seasons have just been so bad, in terms of performances, end product, and effort. And by effort I mean actually attempting to produce some sort of attacking threat, as opposed to just running around a lot. There are hundreds, thousands of players that would kill to play for United, and to be given game after game after game, and who would love the chance to produce. Val has all these chances, and does nothing. Doesn't even attempt to do anything. 

As an example, look at <i>that </i>Bebe game vs Wolves. Everyone uses that as a stick to beat him with and whatnot, and yes, he was terrible. But he never gave up. He spent the whole game trying to make something happen, trying to produce a cross, trying to make a goal. Same goes with Nani when he used to try and take shots from outside the area even when he was having a stinker. And I'd far rather have players like that, players that will at least try everything, then players like Valencia that completely go into their shells and would rather do anything else then actually have to take responsibility themselves.

404~~~
Such a stupid way to look at it in my opinion. There is no doubting his regression as a player but he is no disgrace, you are either 12 years old or if you are an adult, you are the disgrace, sorry but there is no way a person who understands football would call a person like Valencia a disgrace. 

I am not defending his performances at all but he has alwasy given his all for United.

405~~~
Also, it's amazing the way this coward term has grown amongst United fans. I think people need to get the sand out of their pants when a player puts in a bad performance and understand that being low on confidence is a part of life, no matter what the profession.

406~~~
Thats where we are fundamentally disagreeing. I don't think he is giving his all, and therefore think he's a disgrace. Whereas you think he's trying his best but just isn't good enough.

407~~~
Because he hasn't improved on a great season, he isn't giving his all? So any footballer who doesn't improve should be called out for not giving their all. Some players don't improve.

We don't see them train but from all accounts from the people there, he is a very hard worker and looks to prepare the best he can.

408~~~
Jesus Christ, coward seems to be the new buzzword around the Caf. Mata has done feck all this season, even less than Valencia and yet he isn't called a coward. These players do not go out onto the pitch and shy away from the ball. Even if Valencia never makes it past the 1st man, the hard cnut still asks for the ball regardless. The cowards are the ones who have the ability but aren't showing it.

409~~~
I would call him a disgrace. He walks out onto the pitch brings his shell with him and just crawls into it from the off. Either that or he's just plain fecking stupid because he doesn't even bother using his one asset anymore, his pace. Just receive, do a twirl and pass safely. Or if God forbid he does get a chance one on one with the fullback, just smack it and hope for the best. Taking on the fullback, just bloody kicking it past him and using his pace seems unfathomable to the man.

410~~~
Why? Its accurate when describing a player who is so afraid to lose the ball he doesn't look for it or when he gets it he passes back.

Among the cowards list:

Cleverly
Young

He has played 3 games and scored in 1, not exactly feck all. He is however not being creative enough or being a huge impact and that is simply because of the horses shit playing as wing backs in the 342, Valencia & Young. They are offering no width and are cowards as mentioned above. When we do not have creativity coming from the wide areas we have to resort to playing though the middle, Fletcher and Cleverly haven't a clue how to do that so its left up to Mata. How do you stop United? mark the crap out of Mata. That's why he hasn't been exactly world beating.

411~~~
Its got nothing to do with not improving. Its to do with the fact he constantly takes the easy option. Rather then taking any responsibility to make something happen, to beat a man, to whip in a decent cross, he'll just turn backwards and pass it to someone else to deal with, or he'll just smash it at the defender. And he's been doing it for over two years now. 

Its beyond ridiculous.

412~~~
I see, so you would prefer a player who has spent 2 seasons smashing it against the shins of the opposition LB to carry on trying to? To show he has heart? If you ask me, I'd rather Antonio passed the ball back to the players who have the ability to hurt the opposition. When all Rooney and Mata have been doing for the past 3 games is get the ball in a central position and swing it out to Valencia, who is the real coward? The one who has been shit for 2 years or the guys who have genuine ability but aren't showing it? It's not a coincidence that we go from playing the best football we have for a few years in pre-season to being shit in the PL. These million pound signings who are above criticism are fecking shitting their keks and are just moving the ball to others who are genuinely poor players now.

413~~~
Yes, he takes the easy option, as do many players but because we have seen him play much better, we won't accept anything else. We watch from our chairs at home, he is on the pitch seeing something different. It's so easy to sit and here and say take him on but on the pitch, he might not have the same sense. Again, there is no doubting his regression and I don't see a future for him at United but to call him a disgrace is way over the top, especially as you are basing that on performance levels.

414~~~
He shut down his Twitter account.  Apparently after this weekend's Ecuador friendly v. Bolivia he's received a lot of unfavorable comparisons to Renato Ibarra, Ecuador's young winger who plays for Vitesse in Holland.

415~~~
So he doesnt manage to stand out in that shitty Ecuadorian side nowadays?

416~~~
Must be pretty low on confidence for nearly 3 years now is it? i reckon he should probably go about starting to address that problem.

417~~~
I don't have a problem at all with him not being good enough, but there is no doubt that he puts in a shift and does his defensive duties for instance, even when he comes up lacking in attack. 

Calling him a disgrace, however, is a disgrace. He has said or done nothing to disgrace the club. If he plays poorly, it is the manager's duty to take him out of the starting XI. Thus why I think your comments are some way off the mark - call him a coward in attack and playing a little shit, sure, but disgrace is going too far.

418~~~
100% spot on, mate - far more eloquently put than what I managed!

419~~~
Has been terrible for a while now.  Lack of confidence, our slow buildup play, and not having Rafael or a competent RB have all contributed.

He isn't a coward. Let's be realistic here.

420~~~
Valencia doesn't look for the ball now? What a lot of old horse shite. He probably gets the ball more than anyone on the team.

421~~~
He's a core part of our slow build up play issue. You want your wingers to carry the ball forward at pace and make up ground into the opponents half. When he's the main focus of our output through midfield and his natural instinct is to stop and pass it back you don't have a fecking chance.

422~~~
Well our tactics for the last 3 seasons has been to pass to valencia. Horrible and predictable tactics that teams have found out. This has a lot to do with Antonio s poor form in my opinion . It has snowballed and now his confidence is shot and was evident at the world cup too.

423~~~
...and then tries his damnedest to do the least of everyone with it.

424~~~
He isn't somebody who hides from the ball. He lacks the confidence to do much with it. He keeps getting picked so maybe he's doing something the managers want him to do.

425~~~
I agree with you but a lot of Utd fans are contrary hyperbolic planks - in the same way Fletcher was derided for years and now he's treated as a hero (by the same ppl), the first 3 years of Valencia's career here have been wiped MIB style. Only the past 2 years count (one in which he was reserved but had a great relationship with Rafael and we won a title).

AV has last his confidence and with the ball goes for safety first - it's a regression that started with the pressure of wearing the #7 and the effects are still there. But to call him a coward is ridiculous. I've seen some of our own players cry off for a sub with a little knock, others in tears - he couldn't see out of one eye and played on until the sub was force don him. Coward indeed.

426~~~
If not for that coward assisting Mata and helping us get a draw we've be lower than 14th atm <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Lacking confidence is not the same as being a coward. Ashley Young has shown cowardice (diving, evading 50/50). Clev has by hiding in CM when CBs needed an outball - AV has never shown cowardice. He is limited and lacking confidence in what he can do well. Up to the gaffer9s) to drop him - we obviously don't have better alternatives to wingback with Rafael unfit...

427~~~
Bloody hell......

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://giant.gfycat.com/WholeHelplessGoosefish.gif" src="http://giant.gfycat.com/WholeHelplessGoosefish.gif"/>

428~~~
LVG looks disgusted at that pass.

I want the old Valencia back.

429~~~
The fecking space he had to run into, a square pass to his left or a long pass on to the left wing to what looks like Januzaj. Push the ball out of his feet in either direction and he'd have created 5 more options. 

Send him to the glue factory already.

430~~~
That gif <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

431~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The way he just stands still.

432~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

433~~~
He shouldn't be playing unless we are  desperate, which we have been so far. It's painful watching him stand there and face the defender, with absolutely no clue what to do. I'm praying Rafael comes back and stays fit so we don't have to suffer his shite too much.

434~~~
Don't really get what is laughable about that gif. Complete lack of options there. He's the last line of defence there, he's obviously not going to try and dribble past someone and nobody is making much of an effort to get into space for a pass. Especially Anderson, who does his usual "run behind the nearest opposition player" trick. I reckon Van Gaal is as pissed off with the poor movement off the ball as he is with the conservative pass.

I know people think I just defend Valencia for the sake of it but that gif is a really strange criticism. If you had one of him repeatedly smashing the ball into the full-backs shins, that would be a different story...

435~~~
It's pretty accurate at how messed up our whole play/movement is at the moment, in general, as a team
However, it doesn't reflect well on Tony V either.

436~~~
What should he have done though? The only United player in space to receive a pass was Blacket and he clearly didn't want the ball, hence he was pointing towards the opposition box. So what was the next best option? Like I said, doing anything risky when you're the last line of defence would have been the height of stupidity. I don't see what other - sensible - pass was on?

437~~~
Regardless he didnt have a picture in his head. Tyler Blackett should have got that ball first time or a shift out the feet to the player on the right. By the time he made up his mind he was closed down.. As expected in the EPL.

438~~~
I agree. Whilst Valencia has been VERY underwhelming for a while now that little gif really shows our problem on the whole at the moment. First of all what is he doing in that position collecting the ball? Secondly why is our play so narrow?

Very very frustrating to watch but his options are basically nil in that clip which has forced him to go back to the goalkeeper from 3/4 of the way towards the opposition goal. Appalling from the team.

439~~~
Giving it to Mata was a better choice or even attempting to switch it over to Januzaj. 
It's not the pass back that does my nut in, it's how he had so much time, even some space to move into, and yet he just waited to be closed down. It's peculiar.

Even if he did hit it out to Blackett, he could have then knocked it on to Januzaj and Burnley would have been on the back foot again. Blackett was pointing out to Januzaj, so it was obviously in his head to get the ball out to him. Instead, the pass to De Gea gave them a chance to regroup.

440~~~
Standing still for so long with the ball, will tend to reduce your options/angles.

441~~~
He just didn't know what to do.

It's not cowardice or hiding, he just isn't very bright.

442~~~
The picture in his head before he received the ball will have featured Blackett pointing frantically up the pitch and absolutely nobody else showing for the ball. The player on his right wasn't available for a pass until after he was closed down. He could have tried to buy a moment or two by shifting it to one side or the other but that would risk losing the ball altogether. A very bad idea with zero cover behind him.

443~~~
Yes, risk. Something that he never takes. He stands on the ball for too long allowing the opposition to regroup, and I'm not just referring to this incident, which is obviously after a set piece hence why he's standing in that position, but whenever he's got the ball in space, he never takes a risk. Too safe and passive, literally offering nothing more than an outlet with no end product at all.

444~~~
Not taking a risk when he's one on one against the opposition fullback is infuriating, I agree. Not taking a risk in that situation is just common sense.

445~~~
I've watched that gif too many times now.

Still got no flipping idea what Anderson was thinking, mind you. Why did he run <i>behind</i> the nearest player?

446~~~
For what it's worth, I think he's actually been alright defensively for us this season

447~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

448~~~
I've noticed a lot of our players doing that pointing nonsense that Blackett was doing then. Instead of making a little 5 yard run to create an angle they just stand there pointing out wide or something. Looking petrified to have the ball into feet.

449~~~
Lack of options?! That's bollocks Pogue. The bolded line is the only true bit of that post.

Here's his options:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/n0NWLow.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/n0NWLow.jpg"/> 

First and most blindingly obvious move. Square it to Blackett who in turn has an easy pass down the channel to Januzaj. We're then in behind their defence with 5 men attacking the box.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/t9KeT7C.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/t9KeT7C.jpg"/> 

If he didn't fancy going square he could have gone straight through the middle to Anderson who had Mata peeling off him. He could easily have made this pass and then made himself availible for the return in the acre of space ahead of him and he'd still have been positioned correctly defensively.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/6YERKKN.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/6YERKKN.jpg"/> 

Alternatively, as the play developed if he didn't have the ball underneath his feet, something that is taught out of players at U9's level and actually had the ball in a position to pass it, he could have gone long to Januzaj who was moving into acres of space on the left hand side. A ball that would have been relatively risk free with Blackett also covering that channel and a host of United players moving back towards the half way line.


<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/xCStIoI.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/xCStIoI.jpg"/> 

Also, earlier on in the move, rather than standing with the ball under his feet he could have pushed it forward into the space he had ahead of him. He'd have been clear of the man closing down on him and he'd have opened up numerous options. At any time if he felt the man was closing in too fast on him he could have played the easy out to Blackett.



Instead he stood over the ball, did nothing and played it back to the goalkeeper. It's the just the cowardly bollocks he's constantly blasted for doing on here.

450~~~
I've actually gone through almost all of those options in my last few posts. Still images don't paint the real picture as you can't see Anderson actively hiding, Blackett making it clear he doesn't want the ball or the speed at which he is closed down. Nice work though. Lots of pretty arrows.

451~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's beyond shite. Sign a new RB or get Rafa fit or play Young. No more Valencia..please.

452~~~
Blackett making it clear he doesn't want the ball? He's standing in an acre of space with an easy pass down the channel, who gives a feck what you think he wants, you pass it to him. You don't stand over the ball, not moving it to either side to create space for yourself or get ready for the pass.

I genuinely don't get why you are constantly making excuses and apologising for him. You're making a fecking fool out of yourself. 99.9% of United fans can see he's garbage and how much his importance is hindering our game.

453~~~
Yes. Look at his left arm. Blatantly doesn't want the ball.

Couldn't give a shit what 99.9% of United fans think. All I'm doing is give my own opinion. He's completely lost his attacking mojo but is coping with the new formation/approach better than most. Defending quite well and got our only assist from open play this season. Not really worthy of all this hatred. Not fussed at all if you (or anyone else) disagrees.

454~~~
So tell me, what do you think he actually brings to the team that is positive?

455~~~
Yeah his left arm is pointing up field into the space in front of him or towards Januzaj. How is holding his left arm up like that indicating he doesn't want it? Because clearly passing the ball back in this scenario was the right decision. Right, makes sense. He's a shit player and adds nothing to the team, and this few seconds of play sums up his effectiveness, or lack thereof.

456~~~
This season? Same as he always brings. When we have the ball he's always available for a pass and almost never loses possession cheaply. When we don't have the ball he makes a lot of tackles and shores up the right side of our defence significantly (as compared to the left flank, where we're constanly getting exposed)

Obviously, he's been mainly crap in the final third for ages now. This genius fecking formation which means he has no fullback to make overlapping runs has made him even more ineffective. This lack of creativity is a real issue and might mean the end of him at United if he can't get his swagger back. 

As part of a team who are all underperforming to various extents he certainly doesn't deserve the bile being spewed in this thread. Not based on his performances this season anyway.

457~~~
Ando in that gif. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

458~~~
ave you played football before? If you want the ball you don't tell someone to pass it to someone else.

459~~~
Oh my god, he actually runs and hides behind the Burnley player <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

460~~~
That GIF is defending a counter from a attacking set piece where he is last man no ? 

Not sure you'd want him trying to take on players there. Or anyone.

461~~~
I first said he didn't have passing options but <a class="username" data-user="44029, @Pexbo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44029/">@Pexbo</a> is correct. The Ando pass is a piss easy one and puts us in a great position. Not sure what Anderson is doing two seconds later though.

462~~~
The strangest thing about it is that rather than talk about it when it actually happened we're now dragging up footage from a game played ten days ago just to have a fresh dig. People actually seem to take enjoyment from it.

463~~~
They 2 are the last men there while the team is up front attacking a counter. You want a square pass played in that scenario when Blackett doesn't want it?

Blackett is seeing the Burnley player come near him and no quick pass options in front and clearly doesn't want it. Maybe one of them should be dropping deeper into space but he isn't in acres of space exactly. i.e if he takes One touch then the Burnley player will be on top of him and he will have to hurry the pass or risk losing the ball and setting the Burnley player through.

Valencia has been shit but that's a weird criticism.

He passes to Anderson surrounded by 3 Burnley players and if he loses the ball then the Counter is On immediately with 4/5 Burnley players ahead of the ball vs 2 United players behind.

With our players not rushing back quickly the long ball aerially seems the best bet there but seems some would be offside then.

464~~~
It's this mentality of fear of closed spaces that has led to us being such a cartoon team. Teams play these passes in between the lines all the time. Anderson is surrounded by players a few seconds into that clip but initially he's comfortable.

465~~~
Burnley players seem way quicker in that situation and well positioned in the clip for their jobs than our players. Firstly it's Anderson and 2nd passing to him there doesn't leave Anderson with exactly many options either as he will get closed down in a instant from 3 sides with Burnley in good shape to Counter. 3 of our players are offside and then 3 are flat behind their markers.

Don't remember, what lead to that scenario beforehand but since he has been closed down by the time the team gets in some sort of shape i don't think passing back is the worst decision there at all. All teams do that when in such a situation as well. (Evra did it plenty of times as well in such a scenario.)

The team should be rushing back quicker there getting into space and onside and couple of players pulling wide to get into a crossing area.

466~~~
Looking at that gif, when he receives the pass, there are five players who are in an onside position and only Welbeck whose offside, and Burnley defence is all over the place, if he just clips the ball in with any half decent accuracy we could have had a chance.

467~~~
Some guys on here expect the opposition to stand still whilst whilst we pass the ball around, lol. If I'm playing a 20 yard ball into the heart of their half with all 11 of their team behind, do people not expect someone to try to intercept it??

468~~~
The pass to Blackett was an obvious one. Either way, the entire GIF sums up Valencia's wank game, as well as our even wankier off the ball movement. Valencia shouldn't be anywhere near the first team at the moment.

469~~~
Wait, people are saying there's nothing wrong with what Valencia did in that GIF? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You've got to love this place.

470~~~
Huh? My point is that Blackett was clearing telling Valencia to push it upfield. To get it upfield he had plenty of space to either pass it to Blackett or ping it across field to Januzaj. Or any of the other options <a class="username" data-user="44029, @Pexbo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44029/">@Pexbo</a> said. 

Though this whole argument is moot because Valencia can't pass if his life depended on it.

471~~~
You have to ask yourself if there is any winger at top clubs out there that plays week in week out that would have played that ridicolous pass.
Ando's movement of course is a freaking joke, but he's done anyway.
Blackett pointing somewhere? Well good for him the pass to him was still obvious, he can point wherever the feck he wants. 
BUt passing the ball back like 50 yards? feck my life. LvG's facial expression says it all really. 

Val better gets his shit together soon, he's unbearable atm.
Have to agree with Pogue that this formation doenst help him much but at least it focuses more on his defensive duties, which are still there. 
Offensively he is just not there anymore, no matter whether he got that assist this season or not.

472~~~
Even funnier are responses like yours - there are about 5-8 burnley players between him and anyone but Blackett. His only options are

1. Launch a ball in the air that Januzaj may or may not reach, which could equally be too long and go out of play. Burnley ball. Trying that pass on the ground past 3 Burnley players would most likely be an interception.

2. Try and pass to Ando who is surrounded - if the pass is intercepted (y'know because players aren't statues) or Ando miscontrols and/or is tackled and he loses it, there is a Burnley counter on with only Valencia and Blackett in between DDG and about 4 Burnley players

3. Pass it back to DDG and allow our attack to reset/spread out, stretching the compact 10-man defence of Burnley again and try again - the option he took after no one moved to give him a pass.. And no Blackett was telling him to try and get it to Januzaj which was an unlikely ball at that point.

4. Try and beat the man, lose it possibly and have Blackett defending a counter

He could have gone for a risky pass/move but given we had lost the last match (cup) and needed to make sure we didn't lose, and there was little movement, what he did was fine and not something for people to harp on, especially given how poor our defenders have been. With Rio or Vida there I would say yeah..but Blackett and AV defending a counter?!

If he had tried the more risque options and a goal was scored due to a bad pass or interception van Gaal would have been even more upset! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<a class="username" data-user="58504, @bugmat" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/58504/">@bugmat</a> agreed.

Sure it looks bad but at the end of the day, he kept the ball and every other option would have placed his teammates in a dangerous position.

474~~~
In that gif, never mind Valencia but wtf is Ando doing ?

475~~~
closed his twitter down due to abuse apparently.

476~~~
Seriously? That ball to Januzaj was supposed to be risky? How? As it may cause a Burnley throw in?

If that is the case we might as well never try and make a difficult pass lest we lose possession. We had them in their half and their defenders were not in shape after the corner. We had so many players in their half that we could actually get in the box. But he decided to pass to to DDG which not only pushed us back but allowed Burnley to get their shape back and press us more.

I really hope you don't complain when Young passes the ball back everytime to put defenders from the half way line instead of taking his man on or trying a more difficult pass. Because by your theory that might lead us to losing the ball.

477~~~
That's a bit of a shame if true. Must be horrible copping that sort of stuff every single day.

478~~~
So, a player shouldn't play risky passes? He had his options, but he just stands there with the ball until he is closed down and then plays a long back pass all the way back to his own box. But yes <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a>, nice arrows indeed.

479~~~
*slow handclap* Our global network of "fans" doing us proud, once again.

480~~~
I remember that moment when it happened, you can't defend that. He had so much space and allowed himself to be closed down then panicked, no composure.

481~~~
Apparently he got a lot of shit of Ecuadorian pll (fans?) for his performances for the National team.

482~~~
For what it's worth I might be his harshest critic but in no way whatsoever would I condone that. Similarly if I'm at Old Trafford and he was playing he'd have my full support. 

I think it's a totally seperate thing though, criticising him on a forum like this, as the nature of a forum is debate and discussion from both sides of opinion.

483~~~
He received threats after his game for Equador. If its been United fans, he'd have closes down his twitter at least am year ago.

484~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Valencia opts for an international break</b></span>

If he's received abuse then it's for not playing recently or thinking of retiring i imagine ?

United fans won't have helped either. Might be a cumulation of United fans making it tough only too.

485~~~
The difference between bad-mouthing a footballer in a forum and bad-mouthing him on twitter is the difference between slagging someone off when they're not around versus screaming abuse in their face. 

Both scenarios are a little mean-spirited but life would be very dull if we never spoke ill of someone we never met. However it's a cnut's trick to seek someone out and abuse them in person.

486~~~
So now you're accusing me of bitching behind his back? Tucking hell man, I can't win!


:tongue:

487~~~
<a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> <a class="username" data-user="44029, @Pexbo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44029/">@Pexbo</a> 

That entire scenario, IMO, is a good summary of where the team finds itself at the moment. Those gifs make it look foolish on Valencia's part, but it doesn't summarise the entire context.

Slow, lack of urgency and movement just about sums up the entire team over the past 12-18 months.

Valencia is partly responsible for that ridiculous back pass - but look at the movement of the Burnley players (the urgency to get out and press the ball) versus that of the United players. FFS, Anderson even goes and plays hide and seek.

The only player I can actually see actively trying to give Valencia an option is Mata (that is Mata, bottom right corner of the gif, right?). But he moves a little too late when Valencia has already turned his back for the back pass.

Agree with what <a class="username" data-user="4910, @amolbhatia100" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/4910/">@amolbhatia100</a> says as well. For a top team, our players don't half coward out of taking risks or making the difficult decisions. maybe it's a culmination of confidence etc?

Let's just hope LvG and the new players bedding in can sort it out.

488~~~
I'm a total bitch, in real life and on here. Like I said, life would be boring if you couldn't indulge in the occasional bit of character assassination amongst friends.

489~~~
Made me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> a bit.

490~~~
What happened was Renato Ibarra (Vitesse) had a great game against Bolivia on the right wing for Ecuador and a lot of fans posted on Valencia's Twitter saying he should be replaced.  The World Cup was a huge disappointment for Ecuador and Valencia received a lot of criticism in the Ecuadorian press especially for the needless red card against France.

As an Ecuador fan I can tell you everyone is surprised Valencia is still starting for Utd.  He's been poor for the NT over the last year as well.

491~~~
Who is cover at right wing back? Is Saidy Janko going to get games in the first team? Rafael, Valencia, Janko?

492~~~
He  ist be a beast in training sessions. It's the only way I can explain it. That and the obvious lack in competition for his position

493~~~
I'd hope it's his last season at the club. He was a very good player for us from 2010-2012 but the last couple of years he's been horrendous and I'm not really sure why.

494~~~
Why exactly did he get a new contract? I just don't see the logic unless it was expiring at the end of the season. He's been horribly bad for a significant period of time now. I remember the days when he was an absolute beast, but they seem a very distant memory nowadays.

495~~~
His contract wasnt running down. Even if it was, I would rather lose him for nothing (not like we would have got much for him anyway) than to see him play another game in a United shirt.

496~~~

497~~~
It is a joke that guys who have stayed for many years in England cannot speak it decently. Anderson is the best example of that.

498~~~
But some people just cant take up other languages, i do agree though.

499~~~
Hopefully he won't need to learn and he gets fecked off next summer.

500~~~
I agree that some should put more of an effort in to learn the language of whatever country they are in. But seriously, would we have used this as a stick to beat him with a few years ago. Now we are just clinging to anything. I know it would take me 20+ years to get a sentence out in a foreign language.

501~~~
Surely after 8 years you can catch some basic English at least just by listening to others speak it around you and watching TV an shit. He seems a bit thick, tbh.

502~~~
After 8 years ? I'd understand if we're talking about Chinese, Russian or Ethiopian (languages with a completely different writing and all). English is one of the easiest languages to learn tbh, it's so practical.

503~~~
SAF said he was doing double lessons during the week.

Maybe he just struggles with english.

504~~~
To us it is.

505~~~
I'm from Djibouti and I hold a french passport, it took me 3-4 years in a non english environment to speak at an ok level.

506~~~
Here have an internet sticker.

Nah, good on you but I still don't see it as a reason to throw shit at Valencia, him hitting the shins of a defender has nothing do with him holding a conversation with the tea lady.

507~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I was not criticizing Valencia tbh, more like Anderson.

508~~~
"Oh so you mean <b>don't</b> hit the defenders legs and <b>do </b>try to actually get past him and <b>do</b> use my left foot and <b>don't</b> foul people so fecking often."

509~~~
After 8 years he really should be fluent in english. And english is not so hard to learn as opposed to some other languages (my sad story with German language <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> ).

DDG isn't particulary good in english too.

510~~~
Crossing lessons might be more beneficial if he wants to save his United career

511~~~
There was a interview with him on MUTV a couple of weeks back, his English is pretty good.

512~~~
Maybe I'm wrong then, he had a speech when he won a player of the year award and his english didnt sound particulary good.

513~~~
I do not believe that him becoming fluent in English will make him any less shit

514~~~
I am really surprised this hasn't been done before tbh and I think LVG is bang on doing this. How can they expect to carry out instructions at vital minutes if they're not all speaking the same lingo? I can't believe Tony has been in the UK 8 years and can't speak English!

515~~~
Maybe he just isnt 'smart' enough to learn a foreign language.. the way he plays (run in a straight line -> try to cross the ball -> smack the cross against the defender) doesnt show much intelligence.

But seriously... 8 years and still not an acceptable level of English? He sure must have some social interaction with English speaking people or watch some English tv?

516~~~
I hope Weaste doesn't end up as his tutor, he could fall in love with him.

517~~~
Or maybe he's just not social? He doesn't look the friendliest. Either way, if Rooney can speak the language, I'm sure anyone can.

518~~~
I laughed

He seems like a quiet guy anyway, probably limits his vocabulary in a 2nd language even more.  I can imagine LVG will be saying "look at me and how many languages I know, you should manage at least one other language".

519~~~
50/50.

520~~~
Not sure what are you implying but compare to Japanese, Arabic , etc... English is kindergarten. I wouldn't say its easy to master (for most people) though. But tbh Valencia doesn't look very smart  so...

521~~~
I've seen the interview ottosec was on about. He's definitely improved since that speech.

522~~~
I'm saying it is easy for a person who speaks English to perceive English as easy. That's only natural. Some people who don't speak English might find it harder to learn than others.

523~~~
Fair enough. 

Anyway Antonio to the books!

524~~~
That at 86' sums him up perfectly.

525~~~
Donkey needs to leave United ASAP. Bigger deadwood than Ando at the moment.

526~~~
Football went to pot once he came on. Appalling footballer. Can't wait until he leaves.

527~~~
Embarrassingly bad.

528~~~
God, he's bad. Every attack breaks down when he gets the ball.

529~~~
Ashley Young>Antonio Valencia. The drop off in quality down the right after Rafael was replaced by Valencia was shocking.

530~~~
That's an understatement. Young is at the very least twice the player

531~~~
What a difference compared to Rafael.. Rafael had some great moments and Valencia was horrible (again).

532~~~
Him, Young, Fletcher and Fellaini should be nowhere near the team.

533~~~
That backward pass <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

534~~~
Horrible when he came on. I'd rather we played with 10 men.

535~~~
So much good came out of today's performance...but you guys are more interested in getting straight in with a bit of player bashing. *sigh*

I agree with what you're saying, shocking at times...but cant we have a wankfest on the good to come out of today first, before once again annihilating him?

536~~~
The very thought of Rafael picking up an injury makes me sick.

537~~~
Antonio Valencia, attack killer

538~~~
I'm having a wankfest in every other thread brewlio<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

539~~~
Can't we do both?

540~~~
He did do his best to ruin a lot of attacks, though. It was strange how reluctant he seemed to cross today, despite having Falcao in the box.

541~~~
He just has absolutely no confidence in his crossing ability. Or his passing forward ability. Or probably his ability as a footballer in general.
It must be an awful place to be mentally. To know you will be playing in front of 70,000 people and not believe in yourself to such an extent

542~~~
He would've destroyed the LB's shin pads if he tried, anyways.

543~~~
as I said in another thread. We were 4 - 0 up...LVG gave him "his chance"....

544~~~
I hope he was watching intently throughout. The wing play, passing and crossing we produced is light years away from what he's served us in recent years. His place in the starting 11 shouldn't be guaranteed any more.

545~~~
Confidence must be completely shot, because it's not bad technique that stops him executing 3 yard passes.

546~~~
He has no confidence whatsoever. FFS he gave up the number 7 shirt because he didn't think he was good enough.

547~~~
I agree brewlio. Valencia is an honest, hard working and humble player who's proved that he has the quality to play for us. Whether the injuries have taken it out of him or it's just a complete loss of confidence that's affected him, neither is a good reason to get so angry towards him. I know people are excited by their shiny new signings but let's not forget the players who helped us win trophies already.

548~~~
He's done here as long as Rafael is fit (big if). I really feel for the lad, he's just blunt.

549~~~
Beginning to think we should have kept Varela as back up this season.

550~~~
Like watching a kid who's won a raffle to play with the United first team.

551~~~
There was a bit where Falcao was in the box literally pointing at the space in front of him begging for a ball to be put into it to attack and Valencia turned around and passed it back to Januzaj. 

I wonder if he reads the stuff thats written about him? He got dogs abuse last year for smashing the ball into the shins of centre backs so now all he does is that even more shitty floated cross to the back stick.

552~~~
I actually believe it's confidence 90% of the time with this guy. Let's be honest his speed is frightening and if used correctly can be effective. Except when he gets to the danger area his decision making is like a complete 180 u turn, from what brought him to danger area in the first place. Would rather he was wasteful with the ball, playing those more risky passes over his possession based backward passing. Very frustrating to watch, and very much in this game a complete anticlimax from the first half.

553~~~
He simply shouldn't be in the squad, not even close to being competent backup. Rafael needs to stay fit, black magic, wishing wells, scouse sacrifices, do whatever it takes to keep him fit.

554~~~
I hope he gets sold and we get a proper RB to act as cover/competition for Rafael

555~~~
The fact that he played for two full seasons for us as a winger in this kind of form makes me cry. Rafael from fullback position made more havoc today in the first half than he did in most of games during those two years. It's really embarassing how he destroys our momentum as soon he is on the pitch, I cannot understand how anyone can defend his play. I can understand people defending him as a person/player from human point of view, but as a player he shouldn't be near the pitch for us, not even as a backup.

556~~~
That was a tear-your-hear-out-by-the-roots moment if there ever was one.

557~~~
I like Antonio, he was brilliant for us first couple of seasons.. never been the same though since that injury vs Rangers and sadly I don't see a future for him here.

558~~~
I don't buy this sort of revisionism. Similar things are said about Nani and the Carragher challenge even though he had a very good first half of 11/12, and if anything - it was the Koscielny challenge in that season which did him no favours. As for Valencia, he went onto have a good second half to the season in 10/11 and arguably outperformed Nani in that period which led to him starting the UCL final. In the subsequent season, he was one of the best wingers in the world and won our Player of the Year award. The issue seems to be mental and I don't think he'll regain his lethal form of the past and he's had enough chances, IMO.

559~~~
He's done IMO, he's been getting away with these shoddy performance's for too long. I would have preferred young to have come on. why did we sell Fabio ?

560~~~
He's tragic.

561~~~
Can see us looking for a right back in January.

562~~~
Stunk the place out as usual, light years behind the rest of the side. Just woefully out of his depth and the crowd knew it.

563~~~
Again looked like a FC United of Manchester player that took a wrong turn and stumbled into the Old Trafford dressing room where he was mistaken for one of our players.

564~~~
"Here you go Antonio, here's to another 5 years. Please sign on the line"

Ffs

565~~~
I just had to laugh when he received a good ball from Rooney, actually beat his man and then....played a 3 yard pass to the opposition. If everyone stays fit, better invest in a pillow for your ass.

566~~~
2 years ago that would be a good point.

However, since then he's one of the reasons why we have fallen so far short of expectations. Last season was mostly about our wideplayers not doing enough to support our attack. He's very lucky to still be at the club

567~~~
He's lost his confidence for over 2 years now... how much longer can we use this excuse to defend him?

We simply gave him too many chances and he has failed to deliver the past 2 years, and that's that. He's not getting any younger, he'll lose his pace soon or later. I think he's finished, unfortunately, like many of the fans here believe. He was a good servant for us couple years ago but now we have to move on because he's not good enough at this level any more, sooner we sell Valencia the better.

568~~~
Yeah, his drop in form is inexplicable really, it had nowt to do with injuries, I don't know why people constantly say that. He just came back one summer and decided to go from one of the best winger's in Europe to one of the most predictably awful ones.

569~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27954970" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Valencia signs a new three year contract</a> <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

570~~~
The crowd love a boo boy and are often all to quick to jump on a players back. Valencia is not a beautiful player at all but can be effective with his direct style against the big teams who will push on far more and leave gaps to run into. 

Please OT regulars dont hound him out of the club, for the service he has given and dedication and bravery he has shown he deserves more respect than that.

571~~~
Disgusted to see posters turn against him so much, he's been a terrific player for us and the last 18 months doesn't change the past. Let's not forget the players who have helped us win trophies. Mentally he just seems shot. Perhaps the new signings will see him lift his performances.

'Valencia doesn't look very smart'
'He makes me sick'
'an imbecile'
'an Ecuadorian Llama'

This is too much. He's still a Man United player people.

572~~~
I'm not defending his performances here, just him as a person. There's a lot of hatred being shown towards him and I think that's unfair, and spoilt.

573~~~
Feel a bit silly slagging off our players after such a great game, but the gulf between him and Rafael is just getting wider.

If Rafael manages to stay fit, i can't really see him getting much time this year

574~~~
You've got to think he will be third choice at best when all fit.

LB/WB: Shaw, Rojo, Blind, Young
RB/WB: Rafael, Young, De Gea, Falcao, Irwin, Neville, Thatcher, Valencia.

575~~~
If that's the role he'll get to play at most going forward, I'm happy for him to stay. But, managers do see somthing in him that us mere mortals don't.

576~~~
Thought he was doing brilliantly up until the 67th minute.

577~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Summed it up when he first came on and got the ball and stood there and a guy behind me shouted "come on you prick you're a winger, take him on".

578~~~
Can we post of his gif in the 70th minute when he pulled a Heskey? Actually post both together so we can compare. I think Heskey actually was the lesser of the two evils.

579~~~
And people aren't slagging him as a person or anything, we're slagging his performances, quite rightly so. Nobody will argue against Valencia being a model pro and a good servant, but he's clearly not good enough for Utd anymore.

580~~~
Spot on, he is not a bad as the boo boys and perfectionists portray. It seems we need to have a hate figure and scapegoat to bully from the stands or in the case of most on here their keyboards. DO people forget how Pep praised him after the home leg in the CL vs BM? He can be quite a threat when we are on the counter and breaking at speed. What he does not do amazingly is play possession football as his passing radar is not the best but thats why we need to pick and choose the type of games he plays in. He is a squad player and not a starter and people should stop being rude and realize its a squad game and a long season.

581~~~
Until we bring in adequate cover Rafael it's gonna be Valencia.  Going forward he offers us very little now, but can close out a match at RB and not screw things up?  Sure.

582~~~
The moments when he cut back inside and got the crowd all "woahhhh" and he fecked up the following pass and everyone going "nooo" was funny <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

583~~~
Spot on.
You could see the difference today when Valencia came on, when he did beat a player his final ball let him down again, it's become to common now for it to be a blip. When he nearly tripped over the ball you could hear the laughing inside the Stadium, I actually started to feel sorry for him, not something you'd expect to feel for a someone playing for Manchester United.

584~~~
This whole 'people need a scapegoat' just doesn't wash with me. We won 4-0 and played better than we have in ages...what use is scapegoat today? Could it perhaps simply be that a lot of fans feel that Valenica just isn't good enough? The same thing was written about Cleverley, Fellaini, Anderson, Young etc and look how much better we were with Di Maria, Herrera and Blind in their places. 

Early days but by spending big and removing some deadwood we looked a lot better...pretty obvious. You can talk about scapegoats, confidence, or past injuries but to return to being a CL contender, we need to continue the process and replacing Valencia is a necessary step IMO to get us closer to it.

585~~~
Just because a player was great before doesn't mean he will continue to be. Sometimes teams outgrow the skills a player has, and unfortunately for Valencia, lovely guy that he is, it's almost going to be cruel to play him. A fresh challenge for him would be best for him and United.

586~~~
You said it yourself when you alluded to the ''past'' but sadly what happened two years ago doesn't earn us points now. It looks like he's failed to rediscover his form and I'm not sure how long we can overlook this fact.

587~~~
Did you watch the game their was an audible groan when Valencia did not produce the final ball to the crowds liking. That is what I mean by scapegoat - had Mata or Falcao done that there would have been no crowd reaction at all. Some players are judged on every miss placed pass as if thats all they do while others get away with it. I agree what use is a scapegoat today - I am defending a loyal player who some "fans" were groaning at.

588~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  Don't know what that even means, but it made me laugh.

589~~~
All I see are posters commenting on his performance when he came on the pitch in a thread that exists to do exactly that.

590~~~
Count Dracula

591~~~
I'm all for this if it expedites a move.  Poor Valencia, he needs to be put out of his misery.

592~~~
Does anyone have that gif of his back pass against Burnley? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

593~~~
Learning English would expedite his move? What ?

594~~~
Make things uncomfortable for him so he puts in a transfer request.

595~~~
You're not serious are you? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Ban him from using his right foot.

599~~~
With Rooney, RVP, Falcao, Mata & Di Maria in the squad now poor old Tony V looks like a pub player in comparison. LVG must have seen something in him to agree to the club renewing his contract

600~~~
Wishful thinking on my part.

601~~~
Ppl went very easy on him for a long time, it's just that he has reached a level of shitness most are finally sick of. Other players had a much harder time here. 
Of course that's down to him being a likable chap and at least putting a shift in but that's not enough anymore to cover the level of performances he is putting on a table these days

602~~~
The Baron Samedi of the right flank, when he comes and injects the zombie curse into our play.

That injury was in his first season 09/10, his best ever season for us was the season after, especially his form in the 2011 half. After that final where he looked so far out of his depth he's never quite been the same and has been really poor for nearly 2 years now.

603~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

604~~~
Sadly he just doesn't look good enough for us anymore and hasn't for a long time now. Even at right back you want someone with intelligence and purpose to their play. Valencia just seems to have nothing in the tank anymore. His one main trick has become defunct and he now plays with no ideas or freshness.

605~~~
It's ridiculous that he still can't speak English. Tony doesn't do things by twos does he.

606~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px">Oh I was under the impression it was a thread about this season (Antonio Valencia | 2014/15 "Performances) not his cameo today. </span>

607~~~
Yep, whilst I don't agree with the insults etc (Ecuadorian Llama sounds quite funny though <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>), it's almost that kind of sentimentality that's gotten us in our slump.

Players shouldn't be at the club based on what they've done 2 seasons ago. Fact is, he's just not been good enough for a top 4 club for a couple of years now.

608~~~
No words for that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That had me in stitches.

610~~~
I don't see why people keep bringing up how humble and nice he is as a reason to not criticise him.

He may well be, it doesn't change the fact he has stunk the place out for over two years and really should pull his finger out of his arse or sling his fecking hook and go and play for someone else.

611~~~
This guy is just incredibly bad. The buzz from seeing Falcao about to come on completely vanished once I saw Valencia beside him.

612~~~
He doesn't deserve abuse but he needs to get out of this club asap. I actually wish he'd pick up a niggle so we don't have to play him and blood someone else as a backup to Rafael. I'd even prefer Ashley young.

613~~~
Wrong, his injury was in his second season, 2010/11.

614~~~
That gif always cracks me up. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Surely his contract extension must be Giggs doing, I mean we haven't offered new contracts to the likes of DDG and Jones, yet we instantly offered one to Valencia as soon as LVG took over?

615~~~
What? 

It's a thread to discuss his performances, which will include his introduction today. A cameo that pretty much highlighted why he was dropped and why a large number of people don't think he's anywhere good enough to play in the team. The player he was two or three seasons ago doesn't matter, or his supposed niceness, which is up for debate seeing as he hardly ever looks like a friendly fellow.

616~~~
How many times did he step on the ball today?

617~~~
Sell him and get a decent backup to Rafael.

Sell Young as well and stick with 4 at the back.

618~~~
I laugh every time I see that gif <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

619~~~
The only thing that i want to say is, the reason we are in this position without Cpl football is because, we have let ourselves drop to this level and accept mediocre performances, while we should have been ruthless, and not let sentimentality, or past performances cloud our judgement, and expect players to come good. 

On the otherhand i love the fact that LVG has axed plenty of players and moved players who weren't good enough for us. The difference between our other players and him was night and day, i am not expecting him to put ADM's level of performance, but as a Manchester united player i expect him to be at least competent at his job, just like Blind who without being spectacular, did his job perfectly well and i loved his performance, which is similar to Rojo who was solid and did well. I expect a Utd winger to be able to beat people, Cross properly and pick people out and atleast play with his head up.

620~~~
I suppose those people are right who thinks it wasn't LVG who gave him the Contract, it was Giggs, if it was LVG, he would have continued playing him, and remember that video Scholes, Giggs and Phil discussing tactics and all they had to say was Valencia i like his pace. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

621~~~
To end our healthy debate on his worthiness to ware the shirt: For me as a back up he very much is, esp if we go 5-3-2 as he is not a terrible RWB at all. 
I have nothing more to add, but please don't boo Man Utd players on match days or even condone it as thats bad form. 

Trust LVG and if he picks him or brings him on its because he thinks he has something to add to the game and he would know more than most as he trains him day in day out.

622~~~
Janko will take his place eventually.

623~~~
I stand corrected, however I am right about the quality of his performances when he came back from it in 2011 in our run up to winning the league and getting to the CL final, he was fantastic over that period so I don't think the injury against Rangers is the cause of how poor he has become.

624~~~
It was frustrating having him on the pitch, thankfully the game had been won. I do wonder how much longer he can survive here.

625~~~
He's had a couple of spells out since which can't have helped but it does seem like it's confidence. His form suddenly dropped off from the start of the 2012/13 season yet he still won the penalty at Anfield where he absolutely roasted them for pace although even that was an example of him lacking belief once he got into the penalty area. It's strange that the media still seem to rate him quite highly but he's surely on his way out next summer unless Van Gaal and Valencia can somehow get him performing again.

626~~~
Playing for Man Utd does not mean automatic immunity. You want us to just be happy when Valencia keeps breaking down moves and making us play shit?

If a player is playing as crap as he is playing, for a period of 2 years, then I will not hold back my disgust.

627~~~
Off the pitch he could have the nicest personality on the planet for all we care, but on pitch he has been shambles for quite a while. Most of us are simply saying he was shit because he had a shit game as usual (at least based on the past 2 years). I don't know how that makes us spoilt, unless you are suggesting that we should accept constantly mediocre to awful performances from Valencia just because he was a useful player in the past.

As for verbal abuses like "he makes me physically sick" yeah, that might be harsh, but after couple of seasons hoping for him to be good again only to be disappointed game after game, I'm not surprised.

628~~~
Do you realize when you boo the player you also boo the manager. He picks him to come on and if LVG thinks he has something to offer at that time and you boo him, really you are also booing the managers knowledge of the game.

629~~~
I've got no problem moaning about his performances. It doesn't have to be personal, same thing with Rooney. His touch is poor, fine. He's a massive greedy porker with a hooker for a wife is pushing it. I agree Valencia's performances have been dreadful, it's like watching Charles Barkley in Space Jam when the Nerdlucks/Monstars steal his talent. 


<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tpWgLE7Bl-4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

630~~~
I think there's a decent player somewhere inside him, but his lack of confidence is holding it back. Then again, if he can't manned up and find confidence in two years then he has no business playing for United. That play in the end of the second half summed it up for me. He was in acres of space on the right,  one of the deadliest penalty box striker waiting in the box for a cross, but Valencia chickened out and opt for backward pass instead, which inevitably got intercepted and the move broke down.

631~~~
I agree. We have till the Jan transfer window (hopefully Rafael will stay fit) Valencia simply needs to go, hes not good enough as a winger and hes not a RB. IMO Janko wouldn't be any worse at RB than Valencia is, give him a chance and he might come good. We also have Vermijl both of them should be given opportunities to prove themselves, Valencia on the other hand has out stayed his welcome, needs to be moved on and should take Young with him.

632~~~
He's not good enough even as a back up. Young is better, Janko can't be any worse I'd imagine, Vermijl can play there as well. The drop in performance level after Rafa went off was criminal.

And I heard no booing. In fact, he seems to be one of those players who gets cheered no matter what he does unlike say someone like Nani who gets booed for trying to be creative and make things happen.

633~~~
Valencia needs to train up his useless left foot. With a Sunday-league left foot, he'd be making three or four crosses last night. With Valencias left foot, he had to pass it back to our defender. On the bright side - Valencia rarely make bad passes. Yes, he makes bad decisions, but even though his decision is bad, his passing is good (except for that one pass with his left(?) back to Blind or whoever it was).

634~~~
Can't wait for the moment this guy's thread is no longer in the United forum.

635~~~
I don't understand which games you watch but Valencia is only good for playing possession football. He passes it back and keeps it simple. Does not take on his man and hardly ever tries an adventurous pass. So if we intend to just keep things simple and not create anything, he is our man. If we want to see more of what we saw in the first half, he needs to leave for his own good.

636~~~
He literally killed any attack he got involved in. What's happened to him? He has turned into an absolutely diabolical footballer.

637~~~
Rubbish player and has always been. Players like this is the reason our football got worse. He only knows one way to play. I can't believe Ferguson went from Beckham and Ronaldo to Valencia, at his best I still didn't rate him. Very one dimensional and can't use his left foot.

638~~~
Was very surprised he actually got a game yesterday, especially considering that Van Gaal had said earlier in the week that Shaw would get some playing time, I thought he would of maybe brought Shaw on for Rojo with it being Rojo's first game since the World Cup.

Like I said in the Newbies, Valencia comes across as a very timid character who's confidence seems to drain at the slightest mishap, And since the injury he has had seemingly no self belief at all, I really rated him before his injury but now I just fail to see what he brings to the team

639~~~
That's the weird thing though. He came back from the injury and looked really good. He finished the 2010/2011 really well, albeit had a shocker in the Champions League final, and then in 2011/2012 he was maybe our best player.

He even started the 2012/2013 season okay winning the penalty at Anfield and getting a couple of good assists at Stamford Bridge so I don't know what happened to cause him to end up like he is now. It feels daft to mention it after such a fantastic day yesterday but he really did stick out with how poor he is.

640~~~
Sadly, he's now become an embarrassment to himself. The quotation marks around 'performance' in the thread title could not have been more apt yesterday.

641~~~
Think he'll need to re-hire his agent soon.

642~~~
The difference he made when he was introduced was quite staggering, in a bad way, we had all that quality and to see the sudden gulf was really quite telling. We will likely see similar when Young is introduced back in to the fray but if we're to persist until January we can only pray that Rafael stays fit, perhaps try Young over there in Rafas absence. 
Quite sad to see Valencia moping around the pitch as has been, he's so obviously bereft of any confidence in his own ability and it's affecting any quality he does have, he was never this shite before the injury but he's just not got the mentality to recover. Shame really.

643~~~
Why is Young going to be introduced back into the fray?

644~~~
I find Anderson hiding behind Burnley player more funny then Valencia's back pass. Plus he'll get testimonial in short period for relaxing 10 years at United.

645~~~
Valencia's one dimensional football used to work 4 years ago - I doubt he will have a role in today's team except being back up to Rafael

646~~~
Spot on. Never a United player and I couldn't believe it when we bought him. He's had half a decent season here a couple of years ago and difficult to work out how he's still on board. Mind you if Anderson is still hanging around anythings possible.

647~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
Well yea, hopefully not but Rafas fitness is always a worry and just seeing that dip in quality as he left and Valencia came on, I would much rather see Young as a RWB than Valencia, at least he can actually pick a pass and use both feet.

648~~~
Not even as back up to Rafa. Smalling might not be a bombing box to box WB, but he's defensively a hundred times the RB Tony V ever will be.

649~~~
Which injury are you referring to here? The ankle break? If so, then he had his best half season of his career after he came back from that.

650~~~
I can't believe he can't speak English very well. Amazing.

651~~~
Yea he came back in beast mode, it was like he was never out but the steady decline has been really quite shocking, perhaps he aggravated something by coming back so strong and now feels he can't trust his body. Would explain a lot given what we've witnessed from him, it's certainly a mental issue whether it stems from an underlying niggle or not.

652~~~
I am not sure what is the cause. It mostly looks to me to be a mixture of him having zero confidence and defenders having sussed him out.

653~~~
Thats an accurate assessment. Its frankly tragic watching him these days. Its got to a point whereby I feel fans are starting regard him as a failure in the clubs colours(judging by some of the comments). The man used to be a hurricane. A major reason why we have won 2 leagues since Ronaldo left. I remember that San Siro game in 2010 agaisnt Milan when he came on for Nani and changed the complexion of the match.

654~~~
I think he will be off in January or July if we can find a suitable backup for Rafael. Van Gaal is a smart man, there's no way whatsoever that he will have failed to recognise how much of an issue Valencia is.

655~~~
Depends if we can find a buyer. Not convinced he is even premiership standard to be honest.

656~~~
I think he'd do well at a lesser club that would have more need for his defensive priority.

657~~~
His crossing is now certainly championship standard, or worse. He literally has no aim, or willingness to try and pick out a player. My 8 year old nephew even knows to look up and apply some technique when crossing a ball. It's shocking.

As a player, I'd say he'd still make the grade a a lower half PL club though.

658~~~
Because he's fifty times the player Valencia is. As a limited squad player, Young isn't a bad option to have off the bench. He <i>is</i> a good player. Yes, I'd rather sell him but that doesn't look like it'll be happening anytime soon so I'd rather he come on in place of Rafael rather than the anti-footballer himself, Valencia.

659~~~
I love Tony V, and don't understand the hatred he gets really but then I love all of our players after yesterday, even Ando that tubby rogue
Clearly he's not what he was anymore but he was a very effective player for a couple of seasons his confidence looks shot right now though
It looks like he's merely back up to Rafa under LVG which i can live with, he'll probably move on within the next 2 windows and i'll wish him well

660~~~
I think that is the answer to my question of "Why are you not mad at Tony V for being awful?". The happiness of such a brilliant result after more than a season of crap performances and results has got you giddy <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

661~~~
I think the media are often lazy when it comes to rating players and in some cases even knowing where they play, like with Blind and Rojo. LvG's interviews give the impression he sees Valencia as a defender so until we get in a back-up RB I guess that'll be his get out of jail card.

662~~~
I've never seen such a one footed player in my life, at any level of football from 5 a side kick about with my mates, to watching high level Champions League on TV. Honestly, it is a joke that he will regularly pass up scoring or assisting chances because he refuses to use his left foot.

663~~~
He had that little moment where he used his ability and drove into the box past the fullback only to fluff a simple 5 yard ball across the box. Story of Valencia's last few years.

664~~~
In the 2011/12 season Rafael and Valencia where my 2 favourite united players at the time, sad to see how far the latter has fallen

665~~~
Is your surname <b>Hyperbol<i>é</i></b>, Señor? The man was key in 2 titles and losing a 3rd by goal difference. He may be rubbish now (due to zero confidence) but to call him an anti-footballer and imply that Ashley Young has <i>ever</i> contributed even half of waht AV has is the kind of fairweather fan behaviour we accuse other teams of having. I bet you were possibly one of those "fans: calling for Giggs to be sold when he went through that bad patch f form several years ago too!

AV should always be on the bench once Rafael and Januzaj are fit and in form (used only as a sub), and if we can upgrade on him in January we do so (upgrade on him and Young, sell Nani to Sporting also - start fresh) but the kind of denigration he gets from supposed fans is more embarrassing than his onefootedness.

666~~~
I'm not a Antonio Valencia fan, I'm a Manchester United fan. Right now, that is exactly what he is; an anti-footballer. He offers the grand total of nothing.

He <i>was</i> great for us but now he's embarrassing and is a complete disgrace. He plays like a coward nowadays and currently Young is a better player than him. Obviously I didn't actually mean he's fifty times the player, but then again you knew that. He's shite and shouldn't start under any circumstances. I can understand if he's just started becoming shit but this is now his third season of complete turd performances and I'm sick of it.

And your little Giggs quip stinks of toprèdism. Let me guess? You were one of those that thought Moyes needed more time?!

667~~~
When was Valencia key to winning any titles? 2011 he was out most of the season, and Nani was key. 2013 he was garbage and contributed very little to the attack.

I'm not one of these who has an irrational dislike for him, he's actually a really likeable footballer (less so for football reasons and more so because of the way he conducts himself), but he's not ever really been key to anything. His two bests runs in the side have been in seasons in which we finished 2nd.

668~~~
Good point. I hadn't realised that. The same applies to Rooney as well. His best performances (since '08) came in seasons we ended up finishing 2nd, 2nd and 7th respectively in the league. 

No real point to that and I'm not trying to use it as a stick to beat Rooney with, I just found it interesting.

669~~~
Valencia and Januzaj looked woefully off the pace when they both came on. They couldn't live with the zip and pace of the passing. Fletcher will have no chance. Will Young manage? Valencia plays too safe. A back up player from now on.

670~~~
Januzaj looked much better than Valencia. He nearly scored too.

671~~~
Forget his 2014-15 "Performances"!

Fukking Antonio Valencia could have secured the prem trophy for us in 2010 when he was clean through against Blackburn (the 0-0 match near the end of the season) but he fluffed his glorious chance and made Paul Robinson look like Gordon Banks.  The match ended 0-0 and with that, our title hopes began to evaporate.

672~~~
Amazed that some people still think he's still "okay" for whatever reason, he's the most one dimensional player I've ever seen in United shirt. I ain't denying he used to be effective but like for 1.5 season...now watching some Asian leagues is ten times better than his zombie passing.

For the fact that Welbeck, Kagawa are all gone, Valencia is extremely lucky that he'd signed new contract just before LvG arrived.

673~~~
He missed our only chance in a poor game, which came a week after we lost at home to Chelsea, thus giving them the upper hand. I'd hardly put that against him.

674~~~
Christ. Ridiculous post.

675~~~
Ah, scapegoat for the season settled then. Yawn.

676~~~
I remember that. It will always stay in my memory, and it will always piss me off because it was clear cut chance in which he proved how one dimensional he is(I am not blaming him for missing a chance, I am blaming him for being typical uncreative player that he always was), and probably because two years after that he scored impossible goal at the same stadium which could have won us the tittle.

677~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> okay mate.

678~~~
Ridiculous to say that he's always been rubbish. Until about 2 years ago he was pretty good for us; not world class obviously, but he provided lots of assists (he honest to God used to know how to cross) and his pace on the wings actually used to stretch opposition defences. He's a step down from Becks and Cristiano, but most wingers are.

679~~~
Valencia is a particularly tough situation for us, as club supporters, to deal with.  On the one hand he was a key player in several of our seasons; on the other hand he's gone down downhill and stayed there.  He did fluff a glorious chance against Blackburn in 2010, as mentioned above, but just a few months after that suffered a horrific injury.  Against Rangers, I believe.

Going forward Valencia no longer offers much of anything useful (smashing balls into ankles and destroying counterattacks with far too much stand-up play), but he does make a decent (only "decent", but nothing more than that) sub for Rafael.  And since Varela seemingly has no future at United we need Valencia to cover for the injury-prone Rafael.

680~~~
Valencia, like most of our players, lost tons of confidence after last season under Moyes. You can actually tell the players who played under Moyes are much more hesitant than the new guys. There is nothing magical about Blind or Rojo, they're very good players, but they're not a Di Maria. They still looked much more composed than our players from last season, all of them, even Rooney and RVP.

People need to watch the season review for the 2012-2013 season and they will be surprised how different our players looked back then in term of confidence, speed and accuracy. They weren't all world class players, but they were far better than what we're seeing right now.

681~~~
He was shit long before Moyes  could even think of managing United. Ever since he got the #7 jersey in fact. (2012?)

682~~~
From player of the season to back-up right-back, my word. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

683~~~
Followed the QPR game through the match day thread and then watched the game late yesterday and was expecting Valencia to look absolutely atrocious but, he was far far from it. Yes, he had the one moment where he completely screwed up but, other than that was okay. Guess it's just got to the point now he gets vitriol for daring to put the shirt on and step on the pitch.

He was once a very good player for us and with the attacking talent we've got, if he does find that confidence which he has so obviously lost, he could still be very effective. Has pace, strength, stamina and desire to work for the team- just no ambition in that last bit.

684~~~
Valencia was absolutely shite in 12-13, his fall started before Moyes came. With a top form Van Persie prowling in the box and playing nearly every minute of every game he could only muster up 1 goal and 8 assists in 40 games. For comparison even Nani who was out of favour and pretty off the pace himself got 3 goals and 6 assists in less than half of the game time. a 38(?) year old Giggs got 5 goals and 6 assists in just over half the minutes. The guy is utterly useless these days unfortunately and nowhere near good enough to even be backup.

685~~~
He needs to leave in January for his sake and ours. He's not as useless and inept a footballer as he's proven to be in the last two and a bit years. Somewhere deep deep inside, there's a footballer in there whom for whatever reason or other, has failed to produce the goods consistently at any sort of decent level. 

Maybe he just needs a new change of scenery as I don't see him magically regaining the form we saw when he first arrived. Certainly not at United, anyway.

686~~~
It's astonishing the difference between Rafael and Valencia. As a natural winger you would think he would at least give us something going forward but Rafael is better defensively and offensively. 

That time when Rooney pinged that beautiful pass and he cut inside then gave the ball away was shocking. I couldn't believe what he had done. 
At the beginning of the season I actually thought we should have kept him but that was before the new signings and the formation change. I would be all for selling him but he signed a new contract a couple of months ago. I hope it doesn't mean anything but any ability or impact he had is gone. 

He's not the same player and isn't getting any younger. I said towards the end of the transfer window that we could do with another RB to provide competition for Rafael. More so now. I hope a new right back is on our list next summer unless we're planning to give Janko or Vermijl a go.

687~~~
He only wore the #7 in the last season before Moyes took over. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

Think about it, if he was "absolutely sh*t", would he have played 40 games??

People are being irrational now in their criticism for Valencia I see.

By the way, if you want to look at his full stats, you'll see that Valencia had more key passes (and more assists!) in that season than Carrick and nearly as many as Rooney, while making big contributions defensively.

688~~~
So he was exactly right in saying he was shit before Moyes took over...

Oh and it's hard not to be irrational when you're served the shite that Valencia provides week in, week out. His technical limitations are painful, truly painful to watch.

689~~~
Thanks for admitting it.

690~~~
Nothing if not honest <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

691~~~
Valencia was awful in 12/13 there is simply no two ways about it. If you want to believe everyone saying so is irrational then go right ahead.

692~~~
Yes he did and was so shit we ripped the shirt of his back and locked it away till we could get a player worthy of it. Di Maria.
We can all try and come up with excuses for Valencia like he's lost his pace, playing out of position etc, etc. The thing is Rafael is not faster than him, I'd even say Rafael would make a better winger then Valencia, the biggest difference between the 2 players is 1 has big Balls and the other doesn't and it ain't about confidence either, its about '<i><b>Balls</b></i>'.

693~~~
The fact that he did nothing meaningful going forward is considered an OK contribution from him goes on to show how low our expectations are from him now.

694~~~
The point he came on, we'd taken our foot off the gas. He still gave us the width a few times deep in QPR territory and defended as he was supposed to, so yes he did okay in the short time, same would be said of anyone else gave that performance regardless of who they were.

695~~~
He got into good positions and we played him in a few times and yet he did nothing of note.

696~~~
I have never rated him. He's just get to the byline and cross, rinse and repeat, the likes of Jarvis and Downing do it too, and I don't rate either.

697~~~
The width? You mean he stood close to the sideline?

698~~~
So far this season (EPL) he has:

Crosses:<span style="color: #ffffff">___.</span>0/4<span style="color: #ffffff">__</span>0/13<span style="color: #ffffff">__</span>1/1
Take On's:<span style="color: #ffffff">__</span>0/1<span style="color: #ffffff">__</span>0/0<span style="color: #ffffff">__.</span>0/0
Passes:<span style="color: #ffffff">_____</span>59<span style="color: #ffffff">___</span>61<span style="color: #ffffff">___</span>24

Also worth noting that of those passes, 30/59(51%) 31/61(50%) and 13/24(52%) were backwards passes.

699~~~
While playing as a wingback, you'd expect even more passes forward than a winger, yet half of his are backwards? The crossing stats surprise me, I hadn't remembered him to be that bad, but it goes to show.. he really needs to leave...

700~~~
Well, you should have, he was a really good player for us up until two years ago.
And a really shit player since.

I remember a time when we used to debate over who was the best winger in the league on Nani vs Valencia. Now it's a case of who cocked up their career the most. I guess Nani seeing as Valencia is inexplicably still playing here.

701~~~
I love Nani, and perhaps had looked to at one stage have more potential, but AV reached a height that Nani hasn't yet, it really is a strange decline, definitely personality based though rather than physical in my opinion

702~~~
A height of shitness, you mean?

703~~~
A height of being our player of the season, even if it is just a memory now...

704~~~
Yes he did. And his season was better than Valencia's.

705~~~
That's an opinion and a debate for another thread, but fact remains, one person was named POTY for us, the other wasn't , while I'd rather we actually kept Nani who is my preference, but the fact remains.

706~~~
Nani was named player of the year for us season before Valencia was.

707~~~
He was though.

708~~~
No they were both our player of the season in consecutive years. Nani's was better than Valencia's too as he was the best player in the PL that season, fantasy football points said so!

709~~~
You're having a mare.

710~~~
Come on lads, clearly got it wrong, didn't remember he had won POTY..

711~~~
Nani was on course for a record number of assists that season as well before he was injured.

Valencia has never been as good as Nani, I can only think it's that Fergie and Moyes got fed up with Nani taking risks in the final third and shooting/trying a risky pass, whereas Valencia would rather keep possession.

Nani has had three years of very little football, so it's understandable as well why he has been shipped out.

712~~~
As far as I can see he actually wasn't. He came runner up to Hernandez the year before Valencia won it however he did win players player that season.

713~~~
That's the one we're talking about though.

It's also blatantly obvious he was far better than Hernandez that season so I'd take the fans one with a pinch of salt.

714~~~
Lets face it he was never going to win the popularity contest that is fans player of the year. I put more credence into the player award.

715~~~
Nani fanbois will eventually seep into the Valencia threads like flies to shit. They can't help it.

One lost the confidence of three consecutive managers and we finally paid to flog him off. The other is still getting games. End of. Doh!

716~~~
You mean, like this?

Or this?

717~~~
Perfect example of undying fanboism.

Did you have those saved up?

718~~~
"The other" is here because he can tackle a bit. His days are clearly numbered though. He won't last past next summer, hopefully January if we can identify a replacement backup fullback.

719~~~
Anyone who uses the term 'fanbois' isn't to be listened to. It's a rule of thumb that has served me well.

720~~~
You're in here defending Valencia despite 99.99% of United fans recognising him as a real problem for United.

That is the definition of "fanboism".

721~~~
And the other we had to pay dearly to leave to to the depths of the Portuguese league. I wonder why nobody wanted him.

722~~~
Not really defending him rather laughing at the undying fanbois and their predictability.

723~~~
I'm pretty sure most of us Nani fanbois agreed that it was time for him to move on. No trouble admitting he's been shite for a few years now. Seems some can't do the same for Valencia.

724~~~
I'm not here to compare him to Nani. Nani regressed in his own way and is no longer a problem of ours. Couldn't care less about him. 

Valencia continues to be a very real problem in this United team.

725~~~
despite you doing the exact same in the Nani thread.

Hypocrisy, always fun.

And anyway, nobody is trying to claim one is better than the other here, just that both are now shit and have regressed badly, you're the one trying to claim Valencia is still better cause he's still here.

726~~~
I don't think it's me, rather Ferguson/Moyes/Van Gaal/Giggs.

727~~~
Yeah, right. Whatever.

728~~~
Yeah, I am right, thanks.

And you're completely wrong and hypocritical when it comes to the two players, as usual.

729~~~
Ironically even Valencia's best (POTY) season was statistically worse than Nani's.

2011/12:   Appearances  Goals   Assists
Nani          40                10      15
Valencia     38                 6      15
United career:
Nani          230               41     74
Valencia    193                21     46

Valencia did have a few games at RB/RWB but not enough to make up such a huge gap.

TBH, the only time I really liked him was his 1st season 2009/10, when he consistently produced the goods for Rooney- and had actual variety in his crosses. I thought he shouldn't have been picked for Barcelona in the CL Final, and his POTY season was not all that great. IMO <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>
The timeline which I've put means that I think he was never the same player after the injury vs Rangers in early 2010/11, but I know most people consider his 2011/12 season to be very good...I thought he was getting very repetitive even then. I thought Nani had been a level above in the previous 18 months or so and should have been allowed to continue at the position from where he was doing considerable damage- right wing.

730~~~
Fergie never got anything wrong, ever. Valencia has been starting under LVG because Rafael was returning from injury. Hopefully that's the end of him starting games now. The anti-footballer. Turn back Tony

731~~~
Got me there. I give up.

732~~~
The ripe whiff of irony abounds from you Nobby, there are Nani "fanbois" who couldn't see clearly, but you are so clearly a Valencia "fanboi" that you came in here, not to defend him, but just to attack people criticizing him as part of some imaginary Nani fanclub.

For starters I am pretty sure me and Pexbo would have had Nani, Valencia and Young out on their arses this summer, and even Cina who was like Nani's agent/mother stopped defending him ages ago, he merely pointed out the POTY comparison.

733~~~
Goes without saying which category I would be bundled into but I would have to say Nani's best season at United was better than Valencia's.

They've both been pretty awful for ages but the reason Valencia is still around is because he's good at all the dirty work, even if he's completely forgotten how to be an attacking threat. Nani offers far little when he's also not at his best.

734~~~
I honestly though the days of Nani vs Valencia debates are long gone but it seems that i was wrong. atm neither one of them are good enough for this club.

735~~~
He really is a pathetic excuse of a footballer. I'm sure he is a nice bloke but I actually dislike him he is so bad.

736~~~
U-Turnio Valencia

737~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> so bad that I laughed.

hard to imagine nowadys what a forcce he was some seasons ago. He used his speed and power to go past defenders by will. Every defender knew he was going to use his right foot but he was just unstoppable. His crosses where accurat so that Rooney scored a lot of headers that season. 

Today he is just frustrating to watch. I wonder if anyone on this planet can get him back to his best, give him the confidence back he needs to perfom. Think his days with us are numbered. Janko seems to be the better Valencia in the near future

746~~~

Possibly even a little TOO big?

748~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

749~~~
I thought he did well after coming on. Exactly the type of player we needed to quickly pressure West Ham's players, but it's sad that he's no longer one of the best wingers in the world. This is the exact role he should be limited to as sad as that may seem...

750~~~
I agree. I found myself surprisingly okay with Valencia coming on, when normally I'd be disappointed. A good player to have in that kind of position as he has bags of pace and energy as well as being generally tidy in possession. A limited role it may be but it is a role at least.

751~~~
This is the kind of role he should be used for from now on. If we are under the cosh just give him the ball and tell him to run it to the corner flag. He must be the best player in the league at winning corners.

752~~~
Continues in his quest to create the brand new role of defensive winger. Well done.

753~~~
Was the correct player to bring on under the circumstances and he did good, well he was like a fish in water in that situation.

754~~~
Strange to say but I was relieved when he came one. When there is one thing that Tony is good at it's at keeping the ball I feel. Good cameo from him

755~~~
Who knew that his ability to hit the defender with the ball would come in handy...

756~~~
This. We should save Fellaini and Valencia for our 2 subs late on in the game. Valencia to smash it into the defender's leg to get the corner and Fellaini for his corner flag ball shielding. Remember his cameo at the corner flag last season where he single-handedly wasted the stoppage time...

757~~~
The cheer when he smacked it against the defender was funny <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I agree, did hold onto the ball well. Did get caught out with the ball over the top once or twice. But to do the job he was asked to do today, he did that.

758~~~
It's the role that guarantees him 5 pl appearances per season, fair feck to him.

759~~~
After seeing how much better Rafael was today, he really is not needed at this club. Bring in a specialist right-back to give Rafael some competition and while we're at it bring another top winger in.

760~~~
At the time, I thought it was a smart sub and it proved a good one by van Gaal. Thought he gave us exactly what we needed. Good on him.

761~~~
He's ace at taking the ball quickly into the opposition half and then slowing things down almost to half speed. This is absolute torture during the majority of the game, but in a situation like today, in which we wanted to run down the clock and keep the ball away from our goal, it was exactly what we needed.

762~~~
Your excitement at Rafael's display makes you forget that he's an injury prone player. We're going to need Valencia for now.

763~~~
His substitution was the right one, forced or not.

Shows that LVG is learning... 


If nothing else Valencia adds toughness on the ball, something last weeks subs, Januzaj  and especially on the 4th goal Mata and can lack.

764~~~
I do agree he needs to be sold, as a winger he's not good enough but with Rafa we need a back up. There are other wingers at the club that need to be sold, I do hope in January they are and we bring someone in. Valencia coming on today was the right move for us, playing him and Di Maria on the wings really helped us, it gave protection to the FB's and gave us the balance we needed being a man down. Question now is if we had another top winger would we drop 1 striker and play 4-3-3?
I guess we'll have to wait and see, I would like to see that happen, we would be more solid and I think our 2 main strikers (RVP and Falcao) would be better if they play as the lone target man (even though they are forming a good understanding of each other).

765~~~
Change the thread title. Valencia is a good professional who works his ass off. Doesn't deserve mockery. He should probably move this summer and we bring in a real backup RB, but still.

Not good enough to start for us, but considering the midfield situation he may well play some of the big games for us away at RM with Herrera more centrally and only 2 out and out attackers up front.

766~~~
No I agree and don't get me wrong I know Rafael is bound to get injured. I meant in January, lets bring in a proper right back who is serious competition for Rafael and knows how to put a cross in.

767~~~
Amended.

768~~~
I second that motio. I had hopes for Varela, thought he'd push Rafael this season, not glad we let him go to Real Madrid.

769~~~
As poorly as he's played, his ability to sprint with the ball and get it into opposing territory was exactly what the doctor ordered.  With Rafael being so fragile, we might hold onto him just to play as his backup.

770~~~
I think this is why it's so important to have a player like Valencia in your squad. In certain situations, particularly the one yesterday, where we had to defend, Valencia had the energy to get back and help out Rafael, along with his ability to counter West Ham, which took a lot of pressure off us.

771~~~
Man we are a fickle lot. Valencia has been garbage for two years and he has a cameo for ten minutes where he runs with the ball, does nothing but kills time and now he's receiving universal praise.

Granted, that's exactly what we needed in that situation but I promise you the next shit match he plays he'll again be consigned to the scrap heap by our fans. Our players are either brilliant or shit.

772~~~
Agreed

773~~~
What happened to the top 5 winger in the world who made PFA team of the year? Was taking the piss out of Bayern before Rafael got sent off! He used to be an absolutely devastating player to play against, especially on the counter. Can we please have that player back! 

Very very useful player is situations like Saturday, plenty of energy to run around and park the bus if necessary. Not a bad squad player at all.

774~~~
I'd like to see him be tried in holding midfield once. He plays there for Ecuador, he has a fine tackling ability but you have to see how he reads the game defensively.

775~~~
Thanks. 

On topic, he's a player definitely hurt by us not making the CL, where he could have given us some width against poor teams in the group stage and maybe some defensive minutes off the bench in the knockouts, and some starts in the Prem. Instead, he's just a squad player who doesn't make sense to bring on unless we're winning and need to see out a game.

That said, he'd probably be in my team to play Chelsea, in a narrow right-sided role:

-----Falcao----RVP-----
DiMaria-Herrera--Valencia
----------Blind----------
Shaw-Rojo--???-Rafael

Good lord is Costa going to tear us apart. 

But, yeah I like the idea of letting Herrera run free a bit and hopefully getting wide either side of Matic and give him trouble, and we have another defensively useful midfielder out there rather than Mata or Januzaj, who can always come on later. But yeah, just play like Atletico Madrid, on the counter, and maybe we can sneak a win.

776~~~
I think he's lost some pace. 29 and injury issues. Not unheard of at all for wide players.

777~~~
LOL 

"...Performance"

778~~~
Agreed.

In response to those who mock caftards who refuse to mercilessly trash Valencia, all anyone is suggesting here is that Valencia is a useful squad man now.

779~~~
Playing very well today IMO. The role suits him, not expected to do a great deal with the ball and has protection behind him in the form of Rafa who is also offering the wide attacking threat he lacks.

780~~~
Agree - Van Gaal seems to be on to something. Having a good game and looking like some confidence has returned.

781~~~
That cross.

Gif -

782~~~
His defensive work this week and even for the last 20 against West Ham (which saw the game out for us) has been brilliant, he's trying through balls too now and scoop passes, I'm in shock.

783~~~
He's been pretty smart and effective in his passing too, I'm very surprised and quite pleased by him today.

784~~~
Been solid on the ball and very disciplined in his role. Complements Di Maria pretty well and he's always linked up well with Rafael.

785~~~
I've been incredibly surprised by the effectiveness of Valencia in his new role. What makes him effective is that he's as strong as an ox and has a good turn of pace which will work against technical players in midfield like Pienaar and Besic. Make the simple passes and let Rafael fly by. He's been perfect. VAN GAAL IS A GENIUS.

786~~~
This is why I've always said Valencia should play as a box to box midfielder. He's played very well today, and so far, it seems to be right choice by Van Gaal putting him in for Herrera, as he's got the same energy levels and gets stuck in.

787~~~
Better in CM than at RB or on the wing that's for sure. The only real disappointing moment was when he had to do some typical wing play ...

788~~~
I don't know why people are surprised at Valencia doing well in this kind of role. He's always been good at keeping the ball and in physical battles.

789~~~
He's been ok, nothing special. Do rate him a lot more than most however.

790~~~
He's been quite solid, though i did find it funny when he done his trademark run up the pitch and look clueless when it came to creating something. Hammered it against the full back is almost seen as an achievement for him.

791~~~
For all the laughing at his selection in the match thread he's been perfectly good, that cross aside. Rarely ever gives the ball away, puts in tackles and breaks up the play well.

792~~~
Offers very little offensively so is a big downgrade from Herrera in the same role, but he's played fine positionally helping Rafael down that flank with Baines which is why I expect he was picked more than for his attacking side.

793~~~
Not bad but still indecisive in attack at times. Fortunately in this system we're not relying on him to produce something in attack so it's not a major negative.

794~~~
Pleasantly surprising performance so far.

795~~~
It's tailor made for him, it plays to his strengths while taking his weakest responsibilities away from him.

796~~~
I think he's found his new position, very tidy and trustworthy in possession. Pleased with his performance in that half. Not quite Herrera but much happier with him in there than Fletcher. Could prove to be decent cover.

797~~~
Doing his role perfectly so far i.e to provide solidity in the team and keeping the flow moving.

798~~~
Actually playing ok so far, maybe we can convert him to CM seen as though he is useless as a winger, he has pace, is stronger than an ox, has a good engine, can tackle and win headers. He is linking up with rafa quite well so far, hope he can continue into the second half.

799~~~
We do love our average players don't we?

800~~~
Absolutely. He's a strong man with the ability to turn, which is exactly what this team needed after we lost the ever so mobile Herrera. Converting him from a sub-par winger into a solid midfielder would be a genius move from Van Gaal.

801~~~
I am honestly shocked of how well he has played today. Hes does not set the world alight going forward, but has added some steel to out MF and has carried out his defensive duties admirably. Well done Tony

802~~~
What a stupid free to give away, he's an absoute idiot.

803~~~
The foul for the free kick aside, I was really impressed with Valencia today. Offered much needed energy in midfield with Herrera out.

804~~~
Good game from him. Take away his responsibility to create and penetrate and you can appreciate his more workhorse attributes. Got to the ball first in 50/50s often, and kept things ticking with some good one touch passing aswel.

805~~~
So a guy who provides nothing offensively feck up two fouls in the space of a minute, the last of which results in a goal against means he's had a good game? 

The guy is a joke.

806~~~
He was excellent.

807~~~
Thought he was excellent myself

808~~~
Looked downright competent today.

809~~~
Did well today. Kept it simple. He's much better when he's free off the line. He can drive into the space much more.

810~~~
We struggled when he came off. Baines was giving us serious problems and Fellaini was nowhere near him.

811~~~
This. 

Which means he's improved lol

812~~~
What a lot of old shite. Played a big part in our winner, helped defend against their biggest threat and played a big part in our winner.

813~~~
Was alright. Didn't want to poke my eyes out watching him. Well done.

814~~~
Looked good I thought. We probably have found a new role for him

815~~~
We're not fecked when Herrera's out. Good performance that, dare I say it looked more like his self from 11/12 when he was cutting in a lot more trying to link up with the forwards and playing 1-2s. Rather than just running out wide and trying to smash the ball through the full backs shins.

816~~~
I was worried about him coming in but he did pretty well and his strength/pace does help. Would like him to do more going forward but if he can come in and do a decent shift like that its good for our options.

817~~~
Exactly what I came to post, squad player to cover for Herrera in the diamond.

818~~~
He did well. He's infinitely more tolerable in the centre then on the wing as our creative outlet.

819~~~
The only joke here is you, he had a good game, give credit where it is due.

820~~~
He was good today, i've seen him play like that with  Ecuador, i can't remember against who (maybe Brazil), and he was as good as today. He can do a work in that position.

821~~~
I hardly noticed him, which is a good thing. He did his job, fair play to him.

822~~~
Did what was needed today. Good performance from him.

823~~~
He was fine today if I'm being honest. Made a silly foul, but other than that it was one of his better performances of the year. Can't fault him for too much. It was brilliant by van Gaal though, I'm sure he knows he is wasted on the wing these days so he moved him more centrally giving Rafa the freedom to role up the wing and attack whilst Tony sits in his position. It was excellent.

Sad that our right sided fullback is a better attacking outlet than our right winger though.

824~~~
He did a pretty good water carrier job in this sort of game.

6 interceptions and he killed their attacks with some clever fouls too and carrier the ball forward well though sucked when he got into the final third but was playing deeper today so will take it.

825~~~
Really impressed me today. He has all the attributes to be a box to box midfielder, and showed that today against a decent Everton side. He's definitely the closest we've got to Herrera, and I expect him to start whilst Herrera is out. Good game for Tony.

826~~~
He fouls he gives are always weird, like an excess of power <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

827~~~
Funny i was thinking his fouls were brain dead. Barging through the back of the Everton player and then the stupid foul that they scored the goal from within a minute of eachother

828~~~
Very feisty today and put himself about well, something we've lacked in games where we just get bullied by tools. Also, that sliced ball he played to Di Maria was almost amazing.

829~~~
He was good today, and fair play to him. Personally, I would have him as back up to Herrera rather than Fellaini or Fletcher.

We need players who can put in a shift and are mobile when playing like this in a diamond formation.

830~~~
He was excellent. Got himself about and provided a good outlet when attacking

831~~~
After a slow start Valencia got going today, I hope being subbed off doesn't damage his confidence. It was great to see him start running at players again even if his final ball isn't there yet. Considering he was playing inside rather than on the flank I think he did a good job. Silly to give away the foul they got their goal from, still much better than he has been for ages though.

832~~~
Some were over the top and some were good actually especially in their half. But that was his role and Herrera actually been doing the same too.

The one they scored off was stupid, i agree and bit nasty but it wasn't brain dead or really poor.

833~~~
Made more attempts on inside runs than in previous 2 seasons combined.

Did well, strong in the tackle, doesn't just run to the byline and provides energy in the middle, enough for me.

834~~~
His best united performance in a while for me. Glad for him. Hope he is played in that position and not on the wings.

835~~~
Was solid today. A good role for him which doesn't show his indecisiveness in the final third. Needs to cut down the careless fouls which he started doing only recently. Seems like a card waiting to happen.

836~~~
Thought he played really well today, which was pleasing. I've been a big critic of him in the past, but I think he did a good job making sure Herrera wasn't missed. Made a good argument to be considered first back-up when Herrera is out. (Until Carrick returns, at least)

837~~~
Had a good game. He was a little slow on the ball and slow in getting forward. A few needless fouls but in general did well in that position. He certainly was better than Fellaini in CM.

838~~~
Decent shift today -  didn't want to shoot my brains out watching him so that is definitely a thumbs up from me.

839~~~
As I said in the Match Day thread; the thing about Valencia is that when he plays in deeper positions he gives away silly needless fouls other than that I though he played well today.

840~~~
This. Especially at the beginning, too many silly fouls. But overall, did okay in that role.

841~~~
Good game from him

842~~~
Certainly a more tolerable, if not better performance today in a more central position than he showed last couple of years out on the wings.

843~~~
True, it was his foul that led to the goal. 

I still prefer him in the centre to out wide though. Its excruciating watching him on the wing.

844~~~
Like most i think hes perfect for this right side role in the diamond, he can cut through midfield and keep hold of the ball. His defensive duties are top notch too. 

I'll be blunt when Herrera was injured i was worried who we would put there but think Valencia can play that role well.

845~~~
Did very well today, looked a lot better than he has in recent appearences

846~~~
Best game he's had for us in a long while. It's a position that suits his strengths... it requires a good first touch, short simple passing, and the ability to get stuck-in/break up play... and he can drift out to the right whenever he needs too.

847~~~
Did really well.

848~~~
LvG is edging him closer and closer to the holding midfield role that we've been crying out for for a long time. I think it's clear that we're geniuses.

849~~~
Was actually happy to see him put in a good performance today. This role appears to suit him, lets see if it carries on.

850~~~
I thought he was better than normal but I certainly wouldn't say he did 'very well'. 

I never feel like he's going to progress our play at all, and when he's moving up the pitch you never expect him to actually produce anything. 

He gave away a number of silly fouls, and too often received the ball from Rafael and just gave it him back rather than spreading play. 

I just feel like he doesn't really add anything to the team anymore.

851~~~
Solid performance from him today. Hopefully, he will continue to play like this.

852~~~
He was a great stand in for Herrera but he's obviously not going to be pinching his spot.

Did I see someone saying Valencia plays in this same role for Ecuador? He certainly seemed comfortable there. More so than I expected for a man who normally looks homesick if he strays more than 10ft from the side line.

853~~~
Valencia does really balance the midfield out. We have two cms, in Valencia  and Di Maria that can fan out and give us width. Herrara on top the diamond is probably the best option as he is technically astute as Mata but is capable of dropping in when needed.

854~~~
It's true. After today, I have never been more convinced by our collective brilliance.

855~~~
I was less satisfied with his performance, today he stood out for me as less talented than the players around him.

856~~~
Looking at the size of the guy, I actually think he's a bit of a gym addict who needs to stop bulking and get into a better shape for football. He's too big up top these days and there's no doubting it hinders his agility.

857~~~
He did ok but his passing compared to the likes of Di Maria and even Bind at times showed how he's a level below those

858~~~
He was absolutely fine.  What game were people watching here?

Usually passed it to a red shirt - linked well with Raf, positionally good, competitive - maybe a lack of defence splitting passes, yes I suppose their was.  Thought he was our 3rd/4th best player after DDG, Rafael, & NotDanny Blind

859~~~
Put it a good performance and a good shift today. On the basis of this performance alone, I would place him above Fletcher and Fellaini for the right midfield role in the diamond. Fletcher has lost his engine and his physicality which were integral aspects of his game while Fellaini just runs around like a headless chicken. Not sure what Fellaini brings to the table here tbh.

Valencia has excellent work-rate, is good at retaining the ball with his neat and tidy passing whilst also having pace/mobility which is vital to play in a diamond. He doesn't really have the technique and expansive passing that is required but he does have far more creative midfielders around him and he is just a back-up player anyway. Just needs to cut down on the incessant fouling but his physicality in the centre of pitch is most certainly welcome esp with Blind, Di Maria and Mata around him today. Great decision by LVG to start him there ahead of the more orthodox and conventional midfielders, so kudos to him.

860~~~
I agree with this, he stood out like a saw thumb.  Was genuinely unhappy every time he got the ball because, as usual, 50% of the time that was the end of the move.  And he gave away the free kick that they scored from.  On the odd occasion he got forwards down the right wing he STILL hits it into the first shin he sees - it's like it's some kind of art project or something.

Wasn't his worst performance in recent times, but that says more about what consistent dross he churns out than being any kind of compliment.

861~~~
It's true you could see the difference between him and rest of the team with the ball but he made up for it with his pace and strength. He did his defensive duties diligently and also on a few occasions he broke with the ball and carried us up the field with his speed. He played it simple in possession and I though he did well today and definitely a good replacement for Herrera.

862~~~
Apart from when we scored the second goal obviously.

863~~~
He done better than what I've become accustomed to from him. But still not good enough.

864~~~
Eh?

865~~~
If you watched a player objectively you'd know what I'm talking about. He'd a very important part to play in our second goal. Better to focus on him conceeding a free kick that wasn't defended properly though.

866~~~
Holy shit, Valencia has lowered the standards of expectations so much that now a 6/10 performance is now a good performance. He was nothing more than average, flowing moves broke down through him, he still hit the player's shins the 1 chance he got to cross, cut in a few times and should have chanced his booming shot on one of the occasions. Nothing to write home about and to describe him as a good replacement for AH is absurd because he is bringing about half of what AH is bringing to the table.

867~~~
Passed the ball 15 yards to his left to ADM, is that a "very" important part? Seriously?

868~~~
Picked the ball up with a defender at him, went past him and picked out the right pass into the players run. Yeah I'd say he played an important part in the goal.

869~~~
He was ok in a good way though he still managed to squeeze in his "smash the ball against the full back" routine. Better at option that Fletcher or Fellaini.

870~~~
Forgot about the move past his nearest man, ok that was good. The pass was pretty standard, ADM was his only option.

871~~~
Precisely.

872~~~
The point being it was done quickly and making the right decision to allow us to capitalise on the fact Everton still hadn't got their shape from Howard's mistake. It's not really fair to ignore the good he did for our goal and concentrate on him giving away a free kick in a relatively harmless position.

873~~~
This.

874~~~
Played well enough to stake a claim as cover to Herrera in that position. Another thing is he has made himself an option for the bigger games where we could put Herrera in the No.10 role, push Rooney forward beside Falcao/RVP, to have more solidity in midfield. Should cut down on the unnecessary fouls though.

875~~~
I agree that the free kick was nothing much, conceeding a free kickt 35 yards is nit picking. Any resulting goal is less a player's fault and more a team's fault. 

As for the contribution, sure, given his choices to either just head it under pressure, turn and trap it back to goal,  he did make a good choice.

876~~~
I agree with you, he offered some quality. It was a reasonable, professional performance. And realistically, he won't be starting much when others are healthy.

It's just when I think of Woodward's vision for this team, and the way he is building a dominant and explosive attacking side, Valencia is holding us back from reaching that level. His peak performances are a fading memory and the rest of the league has him figured out.

877~~~
He should now be be restricted to:

 - just a sub appearance in a situation where we are holding onto a lead and not expected to score goals 

and 

- a central midfield role like today where his main duties are not to assist the forwards.

878~~~
Think the first few comments that bumped this thread are a little harsh.

He did well. Effective performance in that role. He may not be United quality, but he can definitely be a good squad player for us.

879~~~
Thought he did well today, good tenacity in defense and provided adequate cover for Rafael, which is all we expected of him. There were a couple of occasions where he could have added more around the box but you fully expect him to smash one into Baines' back anyways.

880~~~
I think he's well suited to that role. He's sensible in possession, can inject a bit of pace from midfield, and obviously works hard and tracks back well.

Still the King of winning corners by thumping it into the defender's legs.

881~~~
Thought he did ok with the general midfield groundwork. Was less surprised he was included over Fletcher after the game than I was before it. He was still too aprehensive when he had space to go forwards into though. His power and pace suits him well in that role, but the Valencia of a few years ago would have had an absolute field day and ripped Everton to shreds with the amount of space he was being given.

882~~~
He had our most interceptions at 6 (this is usually a high start for defenders not CMs) had our second most attacking dribbles(2) and key passes(1 which allowed the ADM shot that falcao turned in) and hag an 82% passing accuracy all in a position he normally doesn't play for us. Ì am sure apart from the 2 fouls you can't see pass, he would have been high on or successful tackles chart as he was always pressing and tackling. 

Also helped shuttle the ball from danger areas in our half to theirs including that time he ran the whole field and then got his cross blocked for a corner to us. 

You do the math.

883~~~
This is true. Fellaini just lacks mobility. Anderson would be the better sub

884~~~
I don't think this guy is good enough to be starting games for us at the wings, and i have been highly critical of him, but i thought today he was brilliant at the task assigned to him, he isn't a Cm, so i didn't expect him to be receiving balls from Cb's and starting attacks which his positioned required him to do, but i have no complains from him and he was excellent defensively, he is a good squad player capable of filling in multiple positions. I actually think if we don't have Carrick back for the match against Chelsea, Him, Blind and Herrera would be perfect defensively in the Diamond with ADM in the hole, Falcao and Rvp ahead as Rooney would be suspended.

885~~~
He made a regulation pass in the build up to the second goal, as I recall.  Hardly like he made the goal or anything.

I can assure you I was watching him very closely, and he was depressingly poor, esp in the second half.  First half I'd give pay him the compliment of being solid and workman-like.

886~~~
Thought he did well in midfield, he's nowhere near good enough going forward to be utilised as an attacking player in this squad, but he has a terrific engine, incredible strength, great pace, and is at his best when he keeps it simple.

887~~~
Agree with this, did a job, muscled them off the ball a few times and played a simple ball, can do backup job there or at right full.

888~~~
Solid enough in there today. Mobile and aggressive enough to be a presence in that current midfield set-up. A temporary option, obviously.

889~~~
That's because you're expecting too much. You probably need to lower your expectations because right now, Valencia is a squad player and squad players generally perform at the sort of level he produced for us today. This is exactly what he should be limited to, and I'm glad that he's produced two good performances for us recently.

890~~~
You have to feel for some players like Valencia, just can't get praised even when it's justified. He played well, solid all around, worked really well with Rafael over on the right hand side and kept onto the ball well. Pretty much the only thing you could criticize him for would be his needless fouling at times, but maybe that was him trying to be a bit more aggressive in a different role then one he's used to. Could be very good cover for Herrera in that position though, gives us a different option.

891~~~
Played very well today

892~~~
Did fine today. No complaints

893~~~
Yeah i must admit he played very well. It was obvious how much worse we were after he went off and how much better he played than Fellaini. Fellaini on the other hand, well he was not good to as the least.

But as LVG said he was tired and LVG decided to sub him. It was a pitty because he was very good but he is not playing as much as last season and because of that he lacks stamina.

We have a great cover for the Herrera there.

894~~~
Having seen it again on MOTD I take it all back.  That goal was all about Valencia.  He quite literally jogged forwards a few meters, then passed it sideways and slightly backward across the midfield.

895~~~
Ok.

896~~~
Had a decent game today, I thought. I prefer him in that role as opposed to labouring out on the wing. Needs to cut out the brainless diving in, though. It's been a problem of his for a little while now. Good game nonetheless.

897~~~
Wow, who thought the awful, terrible, horrible, painful-to-watch Valencia could be useful in a game like that?

898~~~
He was so good today. Really happy with his performance.

899~~~
He was good.

Manager found his forte,take a touch burst inside and find someone who can create.

Lets not get ahead of ourselves,yeah hes a workhorse and did his job,,,,still so many other options on in decent positions out wide and a shite cross.


But good,maybe like dimarias switch at real to a more central midfield role,antonio can emulate.

900~~~
Did anything asked of him. Really useful squad player as he gives us options.

901~~~
Valencia struggles whenever we count on him for creativity, but with the players we have now and in that system he looked comfortable and added steel to our midfield, i'd like to see him play in big games.

902~~~
I think we saw him in a favourable light after that game, purely because he didn't infuriate as he usually does. He didn't do anything good in particular, i found myself praising him for attempting a cross, which even though it was blocked was preferable to passing backwards. Other than that i can't remember anything else he did. 

But he didn't mess up, so there's that. Such a shame it's come to this when he used to own that right flank.

903~~~
That is exactly how I pictured him. He's a hard worker who can be a solid squad player for the team, especially when he gets his confidence back. He's no Di Maria or Ronaldo, but he's nowhere near as bad as the first 20 pages of this thread suggest.

904~~~
No one is saying he is a good enough player to challenge Herrera for the first team spot. He is a decent back-up option to Herrera and ideally we can do with better quality back-up players in midfield but as of now I would rather have Valencia there ahead of Fletcher and Fellaini. You can read post #858 for my reasons. Unless you think there is someone better than Valencia for that right midfield role in the diamond as a back-up player?

905~~~
A better CM or RCM than a winger? Was good today which is good to see as there is a player in there. Love the Caf though still gets stick yet putting in a good performance <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> . Has always been better defensively than offensively (ask Ashley Cole) and is a bonus that he played well there as if Herrera is out we have him and Carrick to step in.

906~~~
Put in his shift, did the simple things and make the right pass to better skilled team mates. Ya, did well for me.

907~~~
Good option in the RCM position - is capable of playing a shuttler role and provides great engine, tenacity and pace. Can go wide when required as well as that his usual position. Obviously Herrera is a better option but Valencia in the midfield diamond gives us different qualities.

908~~~
I thought he was at his best when he kept it very simple just moving the ball along but when he found him self in a crossing situation he went back to what he does best and just blasted it into the defender.

I do think he will do well being used as a back up for Herrera this season.

909~~~
Yeah I thought Tony V had a good game, which didn't surprise me. His work rate, strength and defensive abilities haven't left him, which he can use those far more effectively as a cm, and his woeful crossing/lack of skill to beat a man are far less of a problem. He could be a very good squad option on the right of a midfield diamond. He plays there for Ecuador doesnt he?

910~~~
Always thought he would be a decent option more centrally. Playing on one side of this diamond thingy actually suits him down to the ground. In fact, until he was subbed off we probably looked the most defensively solid we've looked all season. With Herrera in that position we'll definitely score more goals but with Valencia we'll probably concede less. Herrera should be starting ahead of him anyway but nice to have another option.

911~~~
Agreed. As I said before and after the game yesterday, it's a role that plays to his strengths and doesn't ask him to display his weaknesses. 

He's asked to do all the defensive work without being too close to our goal to concede dangerous fouls (well, maybe one) and he has Rafael doing the wing play work wide of him so he doesn't have to run with the ball anymore. 

He also doesn't have to do anything creative as we have plenty of creativity. It's just an efficient support role.

912~~~
To be fair, that foul was about 40+ yards away from goal... If we can't deal with that, then we're going to concede a lot of goals from set-plays this season.

913~~~
Good game from Tony yesterday. He offered a lot more from that inside right position than we've had over the last few weeks, where all our play is either central or left. I'd even say that our overall performance dropped when he went off, albeit he was replaced by Fellaini. Not enough, of course, to displace Herrera. But it does soften the anxiety that our squad is paper thin.

Really wish the guy would use his left foot a little more though.

914~~~
He did well yesterday and showed that as a squad player in that role he has some value, he offers us some pace, physicality and looked more dangerous going forward than he does out wide. Was a mistake taking him off and we suffered for it because Fellaini wasn’t mobile or intelligent enough to fill in for him.

For me there are about 10 players in our first team squad (not including the guys out on loan) who are playing for their futures, he is definitely one of them but he showed yesterday he could potentially find a new role to play and it was right to start him ahead of Fletcher and Fellaini.

915~~~
Not sure was it a mistake taking him off considering he was booked and he is not a good tackler by any stretch.

916~~~
He's a very good tackler. That's why he usually makes more tackles than almost all of his team mates. Definitely guilty of committing unnecessary fouls, though. Which does justify the substitution, as you say.

We did miss him went he went off, though.

917~~~
I don’t think Fellaini won a tackle after he came on and Mata was a passenger so I would have preferred to see Valencia stay on, he did commit some fouls but he doesn’t have a track record of getting sent off so I think he would have been ok to see the game out, taking Mata off would have been a much better substitution.

918~~~
He actually cut in a few times from the right which was nice to see.

919~~~
Got sent off in the WC.

920~~~
Valencia went off due to injury. Was stretchered off the pitch after everybody else left the field.

921~~~
Yeah he has been sent off a couple of times recently for a bad tackle and for reacting to Sterling but he isn’t exactly renowned for being sent off and Fellaini was so poor and Mata so ineffective at the end that I would still have left him on even if he was in danger of being sent off.

922~~~
Really? FFS...

923~~~
I thought it was a decent performance - certainly one that renders the fact that we have never tried this before truly bizarre.

We have all witnessed him losing confidence in his ability to beat a man when playing on the wing, and we have all seen that he has many of the attributes needed to play CM, we have all seen him play well there for Ecuador, and we have had a long time with United desperately needing a physical presence in midfield... it is a real mystery.

924~~~
It's really strange alright.

The only possible justification I could think of would be because he's so one-footed. You usually want a CM to be comfortable with both feet, so wouldn't have considered him in the role until this right sided CM position came up for grabs.

Of course, there's a Ryan Giggs shaped hole in that argument...

925~~~
Yeah, I see that point, but in the desperation we've had there it seems like it was clearly worth a shot from my POV. 

Actually the XI picked at the weekend was the first time I actually broadly agreed with Van Gaal's selection for a game. We were lucky to win, though, fading badly at the end (and the subs were odd).

926~~~
<a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a>  No he didn't. He's perfectly fine.

927~~~
He definitely didn't walk off the pitch.

928~~~
Hah! Look at Herrera in his suit. I bet he was head boy at his school.

929~~~
If it was that serious, every journalist would be on the case. THere's absolutely nothing from anyone anywhere on Valencia being injured. You would think that someone would at least tweet about it but no. 

And by logical thinking, if he had to be carried back to the dressing room, he's not going to be happy-smiley for a photo with Ander and the lads is he? He'll be on the treatment table, on the way to the hospital or even an ice bath. 

No, I'm sorry this claim makes no sense.

930~~~
Thought he did fairly well today! The one footedness really irks me but he did well to contest the ball, passed it well at times and offered movement going forward.

931~~~
Well Feillaini is as much use as a chocolate teapot so his "cameo" wasn't a surprise.

932~~~
I thought to myself during  the game, "he's having such a good game in the centre it'd be so typical if he got the ball on the wing and put a good cross in for someone to score"... He got the ball on the wing a couple of times n did what he always does- smashed it into the defenders shins and put the second cross out for a throw <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Agreed on what someone said above though, its a wonder Moyes never tried him there given his attributes, especially how poor we were in midfield

933~~~
I've always said he could be a good box 2 box midfielder and got laughed at. He has every attribute needed to play there, apart from a hollywood long ball/killer through ball. 

Certainly better there than as a winger though!

934~~~
He did good by his standards, but still not good enough.

I'm surprised to see so many people praise him for his performance, he has good workrate and he's strong tactically, but he can't pass or cross and has the creativity of a rock.

935~~~
I would say the only attributes he has which are needed to play box to box role is his amazing strength and work rate. It was enough for Everton though and he was miles better than as a winger.

936~~~
I couldnt really see him working in that position in any other formation to be honest. Maybe in a 4-3-3 with the right winger being Di Maria Mata or Januzaj cutting in and Tony overlappinglike di maria... He certainly has the energy and pace for it but as we all know, he can't cross at all!

937~~~
He still played very one sided though. He was just playing as an inside right rather than an outside right. He almost never got involved in central or left sided areas. I still think he'd struggle with his distribution from the left side.

938~~~
His first touch is pretty good actually on his right and ability to shield the ball and create space for himself which is actually crucial in midfield. His awareness of play around him is decent too.

Don't expect him to do anything that creative in midfield regularly as he doesn't have the passing or shooting range and his crossing has gone to shit too now as well but he'll be a good box to box player who would put himself about, intercept balls and just keep it simple. One few occasions he can carry the ball forward centrally in a Dembele/Wilshere/Toure sort of way too to speed up the attack in transition.

He really doesn't need to cross that much as a CM tbf. I've seen him play central in few formations for Ecuador and he's done well. In the WC too against France he was playing a central role in a 3-5-2 changed to 4-3-3 IIRC and did well before getting sent off for that tackle.

939~~~
Just watched the game and kept a close eye on Valencia, he actually played really well, he took on players, passed it forward when he could and didn't shy away at all and his work rate was exceptional. I really hope LVG can get him back to playing how we know he can.

940~~~
Fair enough, I don't think I saw the France game. Hopefully we won't really have to worry too much about his ability in CM, the way injuries are going though...

941~~~
Valencia played better playing away from the wing. On the wing, he was his limited self. I was really impressed with him in the first 20 mins, when we were fizzing the ball around quickly. I think he's a standby player though, not in the best eleven.

942~~~
When he isn't required to create/provide crosses then he is fine. He does the simple things very well and is very good at keeping the ball. Well suited to the right hand side of the diamond IMO, apart from the silly freekicks. Think this change in formation could save his future at United

943~~~
he was definately a lot better in that diamond, not yet good but did a job. Squad player at best but you need those as well. Won't start games without injuries any more.

944~~~
The diamond formation is perfect for him because he have three other midfielders who can cover his major weaknesses and he can do all the scrub work which he is good at. We have never been a midfield orientated club under Fergie, playing Valencia in a two man midfield would have be pure suicidal.

I hope he can reinvent himself into a a decent midfielder for us. Like Di Maria he has the workrate and discipline to cover two different positions and he also gives us that added physical presence. Love the part when he manhandles Lukaku. Man's an animal.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://giant.gfycat.com/WholeHelplessGoosefish.gif" src="http://giant.gfycat.com/WholeHelplessGoosefish.gif"/>

945~~~
Why shouldn't people praise Valencia's performances? Along with Rafael, he helped us control Everton's left flank and it was only when he went off that they looked better on said flank. It doesn't even start and stop there. He played a part in both goals - for the first goal, he holds off Pienaar which gives Rafael the space to cross the ball for our first goal. And for for our second goal, he used his body well to get past Naismith and before playing the right pass to Di María. Is his performance better than any of Herrera's in the diamond? No, but they don't need to be because as he's already shown, a 6/10 performance is what you you should expect from a squad player.

<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/108239594" width="500"></iframe>

946~~~
Put in a good shift. Better than I'd expect any of our other backup options in that position to play. 

What I'd like to see him do is pass it quicker. Our team now is much more intelligent and quick in its passing. And he he has this ridiculous tendency of standing with it for a minute before he does whatever he ends up doing.

947~~~
Thought he played well at the weekend in the diamond. It was certainly better than anything we've seen from him in recent years. Maybe we can Schweini him... On second thoughts, maybe not.

948~~~
I honestly can't tell if that video is a joke... seriously. His "role" in the first two goals? Granted he made an average sideways pass for the second goal, but the first goal he literally did nothing. He didn't touch the ball, nor was he really anywhere near it.

949~~~
The video isn't even analysis, it's just our two goals against Everton and Valencia contributed to both. I disagree that he did "nothing" for the first goal. That can only be said if you completely dismiss how we constructed our attack. He was near the ball in the build-up to our first goal, he blocked Pienaar from getting back and thus, Rafael had that extra bit of space to cross the ball in. Without that significant contribution, Rafael would have had far less space and he probably wouldn't have crossed the ball in. As for for the second goal, he made the best possible decision and this nonsense about sideways passes being given less importance (due to lack of context) needs to stop.

This is one of the few games in the last two years where he's made a positive contribution offensively and defensively, yet some are still finding a way to downplay his role. Obviously Valencia has been atrocious for two years now, but his last two performances give me hope that he can fulfil a role as a squad player for us.

Edit: I think bugmat has explained it well.

950~~~
Fecking hell - Mata's pass to Di Maria was an "average sideways pass" also - it's when and where you make the pass that makes it "key" not just the difficulty level of executing it. The only "hard" pass in the whole game was Di Maria's mid-air reverse flick to falcao. If Valencia doesn't make that pass, ADM never gets the shooting opportunity adn Falcao's doesn't get to turn the shot in...

Haters are just so funny - anything at all will be used against the object of hate! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

951~~~
Fair enough. When it comes to Valencia, I can come across as a troll. He's a United player, and despite my dismissive style, I don't hate him as much as I probably have indicated.

But regardless, I still stand by my point that it was an average performance and the main reason many people consider this to be exemplary is because he's set the bar so low in the past two years that any match where he doesn't shit the bed is considered an excellent outting. Again, that might not be fair to you, but to me it is.

952~~~
It was an average performance.Granted it's better than Valencia's normal performance but doesn't make it a good one.Good thing that we've found a better way to use him but I would still ship him out asap if there's any club interest.

953~~~
He definitely decent over the weekend but will more likely get get found out against the top teams for his one footedness and limited passing range.

954~~~
no one wants to see him in the big games any more, but especially when returning to european football we all know the importance of squad players, a job he can do well. With our injury record we don't even need Europe to depend on those players and youth as well.

955~~~

956~~~
Oh. Well that wins that then. Well played.

957~~~
I think it summed up your post quite well.

958~~~
This thread was titled "performances" in an extremely sarcastic manner up until a week ago because it was universally understood that Valencia simply wasn't good any more.

Forgive me for maintaining that same sentiment despite one slightly above average performance by his standards, against a team that is barely above relegation thus far.

Had Everton tied it up or even won, which they were entitled to (thanks De Gea), this thread would have read very differently after the match.

I might seem fickle, but at least I don't bounce around from one bandwagon of "he's shit"  to "wow, we now have an excellent player on our hands"  after every match, like many of us are prone to.

959~~~
Ah get it now, we can't praise him for a good performance because we might be on some sort of bandwagon if we do, gotcha, Valencia is shit no matter what.
Let's just close our eyes and not observing anything positive he does, for example, if he has a good game, if he plays a part in any goal we score or indeed scores, even if plays well defensively we should just ignore it. He's shit. End off.
Everton are just above the relegation spots at the moment, however so were we only a few games ago, so you could say it was a mid table battle, thankfully for us we still managed to beat them even though we played the entire game with 10 men (obviously we can't count Valencia as a player)

960~~~
He did well against Everton and that's that.

961~~~
Someone has to tell Woodward that Rojo has still some free advertising space on his stomach and calfs.

962~~~
Valencia had a good game. I've hated the player he's become over the past two seasons but let's be objective here. If Herrera gets injured and he can come in and do a job like that every game then, in most games, he'll be more than acceptable. Of course, he has no place in our line up as a winger.

963~~~
Preach on, brother!

This tendency to defend old opinions to the bitter end is the worst thing about the football forums.

964~~~
It's really strange.

I'm as bad as the next caftard when it comes to having some players I criticise more than others. When they play bad I'm probably quicker to make a critical post than I would be about a player who I think is usually solid but just had a bad day. However, it blows my mind the way some people insist on sticking the boot into certain players even after a game in which they've actually played reasonably well. Makes me wonder what game they've actually been watching. If nothing else, it makes them looke really clueless, so why would anyone want to do that?

965~~~
Be careful. You're being just as over the top as I allegedly was.

And yes, of course players deserve praise for playing well. Obviously. Believe it or not, I don't consider myself a troll... But my opinion simply is that he didn't do anything that special against Everton, and given his previous two years of performances here, one above average outing (by his recent standards) doesn't change my opinion that we would be best without him.

You don't see me trashing players here. However, a few players have worn their welcome here and those in my opinion are Anderson, Nani, Young and Valencia. 

This is hardly rocket science, and it's certainly not abuse.

966~~~
If you really think that's the worst thing about football forums, you haven't been here for longer than 2 hours.

I think sites like this attract people who love to be right. It's not so much a discussion forum as an "I told you so" forum.

We all love football and all want to prove that we're experts on the game. What better way than to put some spotty, 14 year old in Malaysia in his place?

968~~~
Your opinion on him has been polluted so much that you are most likely incapable of giving him praise when it's deserved, either that or you didn't watch the game and have come to your conclusion purely on previous misdemeanours.
He was very good against Everton, was he MOTM? No, however he was playing in a position he rarely plays, yet was involved in much of our attacking play, he done his job defensively and looked more like the Valencia of old.
A player can be rejuvenated under a new manager or a new system, if we can get him anywhere near the form he showed during the 2011/12 season then he will be a valuable asset to the team, we will most certainly not be better off without him as you suggested.
Some fans nowadays have zero patience with players and ridicule them for making mistakes or having an off day and want them out of the club without just cause. Granted, he hasn't been great for the last couple of seasons but he has played well so far this season, and that's all that matters. Don't get me wrong I've been as frustrated as many on here, everyone says things they don't really mean in the heat of the moment, but likewise, if a player has played well it should be seen as such and not brushed off just because you don't rate him as a player.

969~~~
He's never looked like a top player after that terrible ankle injury.

It's tempting to keep him around for his fitness, strength and still good speed. But really I'd rather we bought or promoted a winger, a right back and a midfielder instead of asking Valencia to be cover in all three.

I'm a staunch believer in playing players in their best position. 

So much about football is recognising opportunity and threat a half second sooner than your opponent. 

Developing the habits to react immediately requires endless hours of training, it can't be faked.

970~~~
I agree with everything else you said, but this part. He simply hasn't played well. Again, outside of the game against Everton (which we don't agree on), when has he played well this season?

And what has he done to deserve a place in this team ahead of a player like Januzaj, for example?

971~~~
Do you mean the broken ankle when playing against Rangers? If so he got player of the season (Sir Matt Busby award) the following season. I think the worst thing happened to him was getting the number 7 shirt.

972~~~
No idea about Januzaj, that's done to LVG, there must be something LVG has saw in training. Valencia was decent when he came on against West Ham, I think that's what got him the nod for the Everton game when Herrera got injured. Other than that he hasn't really had the opportunity to impress, but he is the type of squad player you want to keep around. As I said, if he hits the type of form that he reached during the 11/12 season then he would walk into the first team.

973~~~
I'm surprised how often the timeline of Antonio Valencia's nasty injury and his very impressive explosive season is muddled up.

For future reference, it goes like this:

Signs for United
Has a very good season
Picks up a nasty injury and misses most of the season.
Returns late that season and looks decent.
New season starts - Has a fecking great season.
Inherits #7 shirt.
Shit forevermore.

974~~~
You're right, I thought the injury happened after. I do think he lost a step, but seemingly not enough to blunt him.

We definitely changed tactics after that great season of his, that was Rooney's only season as lead striker and most of Valencia's assists were to Rooney.

975~~~
This is mythical storytelling that has seeped into the mainstream conscious such as Keano ending that fellahs career. It's been said so many times ppl believe it. His best form came after he returned from injury as <a class="username" data-user="71720, @Getsme" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/71720/">@Getsme</a> says. His decline began about 18 months after, the middle of the season he got the #7 (2.5 yrs ago) - we won the title but he was much less adventurous and was content playing back up to an attacking Rafael for large parts of games. It was imo psychological, as he's shown since then he can still turn it on at times eg Liverpol game where he ran the whole field.

976~~~
Yes, I read Getsme's post, but thanks for confirming the facts again. No need to bring mythology into it, my brain has a tendency to switch things in my memory. Usually I google but this one slipped past me.

If it's not physical, I guess all that's left is psychological.

As I mentioned in my last post, I think our change of tactics did him no favors. If he's not using his pace to get in an early cross there isn't really anything else he can do at a high level.

977~~~
There's a lot else he can do. Most of which we saw against Everton.

978~~~
That goes back to my original point. Yes, he can play right midfield/wing well (though I would argue only his crossing is top level i.e. our standard, and if he's not crossing there will be little end product), he can play right back well, he can play midfield well. He's a good wing back.

But I wonder if that's not something of a trap.

I'm all for having a utility player, but at this point Valencia being our second choice midfielder behind Herrera is not what I think any of us would prefer. I'd also prefer a defender to back up Rafael, defensive habits take a long time to develop, imo.

Of course the team is a work in progress, there is a limit to what you can do in one transfer window. 

But we don't seem to be planning on playing wingers, so we seem unlikely to use him there, though van Gaal doesn't mind a few crosses.

It's a fine point, I'm not saying we can't win with him on the field. But I think we need someone else, ultimately, to back up Rafael and Herrera.

And if we're not playing 3 at the back or wingers then Valencia will find it hard to influence the game.

979~~~
Most definitely we need another good RB - Valencia isn't a good one imo because we've tried to make the change too late - he's an emergeny option that Fergie used (vs buying a proepr RB) in teh same way he used Fletch & Carrick at CB. He never sees blindside runs until it's too late half the time (as he's ball watching) and doesn't have the natural instincts of a defender (as is the problem with Fletcher at RB when he played there before). He'll make a good/decent backup to Ander but yes it'd be good if we got someone of equal quality to Ander, instead of a converted winger..but I don't think that will happen until next summer. Strootman (if we even have any chance of getting him)is a different kind of beast but will probably compete with him (ro Blind)..

Still not smiling.

It takes fingerless gloves to handle it

986~~~
To be fair, they were only pictures of his right foot.

Great. His performances will be even shitter now. 

No chance he'll recover from being on the front page, he seems mentally weak.

Maybe some counselling from Rooney will help.

"I asked if he had a wife and he just said "Hmmmmm.""

1002~~~
I'm surprised he didn't just go for the risk free option and send them to Rafael instead

1008~~~
I don't see what the big deal is? He's an adulterer, shocking that. At least he has some stones still I guess.

1009~~~
The Daily Star are reporting that Valencia and the MP were sending the naughty pics to each other.

1010~~~
They're workout gloves. He'll have been at the gym, got a pump on, to make himself look bigger (his muscles that is), then taken the photo

1011~~~
Still an unmatched classic in the field:

1020~~~
Didn't even play.

This story will have much less coverage than if it was an England player in this country because Valencia has had a low profile and been something of a 'background figure' in our club. But as others have mentioned, he's shown at times that he can be mentally fragile- the way he felt unworthy of the 7 shirt after one season shows that. This could be quite damaging to his career actually at point where he's struggled to play well consistently for a long time. Not good.

1021~~~
So, is this actually true then? The Sun aren't exactly a beacon of truth. I've not seen it anywhere else.

1022~~~
This is the bit I found most shocking.

1023~~~
It can't be true because they haven't made a terrible pun out of his name.

1024~~~
One thing Valencia does not lack is his muscles not looking big enough <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1025~~~
I don't know but there were a lot of rumours on Twitter about this a few weeks ago....but no player was named at this time

1026~~~
He literally is the last person in our squad I thought would do something like this.

1027~~~
Based on the gloves, it looks like he was taking a pic after a gym session.

1028~~~
Sadly - or fortunately - the text is hidden behind a paywall, but you can take a guess at what it's like:

MARRIED Manchester United hotshot Antonionio Valencia has been EXPOSED while playing away with two nubile aspiring models, one of whom is underage & is featured on Page Three. The big-earning immigrant ace sent explicit photos, unsuitable for publication in a family newspaper, but we're owned by evil bastards so we've printed them anyway. In the wake of his sordid disgrace Valencia has gone into hiding, which will hardly shock United fans.

1054~~~
I love it, she is so indignant about the photos but not enough to make some money off them.

1055~~~
I nearly forgot he played football after the latest shenanigans. 

If we're missing Herrera and Valencia against West Brom I'm a bit worried how Fletcher will fill in. Mind you, Valencia pleasantly surprised me if you keep things simple in that role.

1056~~~
Think afro

1057~~~
Please don't make me <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1058~~~
Unveil the Pereira signal!

1059~~~
feck.. Just as we start appreciating him as a midfielder now this happens. Playing West Brom without Herrera as well as Valencia to fit in for him doesn't fill me with confidence.
Is Ando back? Rather him than Fellaini.

1060~~~
Periera or Anderson over those two.

1061~~~
Oh ffs! This is madness....am I in Sparta?!

As the gods are surely conspiring on behalf of our Reserves to get them into the first team, I suggest van Gaal simply avoid trouble by promoting Pereira, McNair and Thorpe permanently to the first XI.

1062~~~
He has an injury and literally nobody cares.

Such a complete lack of reaction speaks volumes about him.

1063~~~
You do remember how utterly useless Anderson is... right?

I suppose the benefits to playing Anderson is that then we can call for Fellaini... and then after he plays, we can call for Anderson... won't this vicious cycle ever end...

1064~~~
At least Anderson has some sense of creativity and a first touch. His work rate won't matter as much with Herrera and Blind with him.

1065~~~
I think my lunch was probably more creative then Anderson...

We should just play Perreria, even if we lose, at least its a youngster gaining some experience... At this point, there is no added value in playing Anderson, there is seemingly no future for him at this club.

1066~~~
What did you have for lunch?

I agree that we shouldn't play Anderson, he has none of the qualities that make Herrera such a good option there. He doesn't even have the qualities that made Valencia do good there.

1067~~~
Perrera>Anderson>Fletcher>Januzaj>>>>>>Fellaini

1068~~~
Hopefully Herrera will be fit in time and that'll solve the problem. If not my order would be:

Perrera > Fletcher > Fellaini > Anderson

Januzaj won't even be considered for that role imo. Also I think I'm largely putting Perrera first because I'm still scared from the whole Pogba thing...

1069~~~
A Tuna Sandwich, and I toasted two slices of bread, after which I buttered and put some Mature Cheddar Cheese on top of.

Delightful it was. Anderson would have been proud.

1070~~~
Anderson? I would rather play Pearson,Rothwell or Harrop there.Pereira over him is a no brainer as the kid is already better than Ando.

1071~~~
It will be Fellaini most likely if Herrrera and Valencia stays out. Pereira on the bench.

Carrick should be close to a come back too ?

1072~~~
Never thought I'd see the day that I'd bemoan an injury to Valencia. But with Herrera out, the thought of having to witness Fellaini or Fletcher again fills me with dread.

1073~~~
Give Pereira a chance. We will probably have to rotate the team for the Chelsea game anyway and he's unlikely to feature in that. He's more suitable for the diamond than Fellaini and Fletcher anyway.

1074~~~
Still can't even crack a smile the miserable git.

1075~~~
If he's injured it'll be Herrera or Fellaini I think who replaces him. Can't see Januzaj playing that position and Fletcher has basically disappeared since the start of the season (which is a good thing).

1076~~~
This is a joke right?! Another f**ing injury!! Ridiculous!

1077~~~
You should try that with a bit of pepper lettuce with that., adds a bit of crunch and goes really well with tuna.

1078~~~
That, and the fact he actually played very well against Everton.

1079~~~
Seems his is in a sex scandal now!!!

1080~~~
Ahhh, hope Valencia's back for the Chelsea game. Think his energy and strength be much needed against the Chelsea midfield. It will also mean he can do a job with Rafael, doubling up on Hazard. I'd like to see a midfield four of:

1081~~~
Plus we have Carrick Mata Rooney Fellaini all capable of playing in there! Feck me we are strong!!

1082~~~
The 63-year-old said: "I have mentioned that three central defenders were injured. Is that normal in a club? I don't think that is normal.  "Then Jones and Valencia were also injured, so more or less five defenders. 




I'd say that's pretty damning of Valencia's attacking threat that he refers to him as a defender now.

1083~~~
Its wishful thinking to call him a defender.

He's really an attacker with no attacking threat at all, but wins the ball a bit more than his peers.

1084~~~
I think he actually said "Young and Valencia" iirc since he counted Jones in the initial three central defenders. I think he was referring to them being options wingback role perhaps? I found it odd when I watched it though. It'd be concerning id he was considering Young and Valencia as fullbacks in a back 4 <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1085~~~
That's a pretty good midfield with enough in terms of energy and creativity. Plus I think Herrera would be more useful when defending from the front and will definitely not go into hiding in the way Mata did against Everton. 
Valencia, if he can cut down on the silly fouls, would be a handy option to have for that right sided midfield role.

1086~~~
Ye exactly. The idea behind putting Herrera as the number 10 is that he'll be able to do a job on Matic, who starts off more or less most of Chelsea's attack. I think as well as his creative spark to damage Chelsea going forward, Herrera will have the energy to do a very good job on Matic, giving him very little time as possible to dictate the pace of the game. 

As for Valencia, I agree on the fouls, but as long as it's not in a dangerous position, then it's not too bad. It will disrupt Chelsea's flow.

1087~~~
Any news on Valencia's injury? I feel he's really important for these type of games.

1088~~~
LvG said no one that was missing last week was ready for this week.

1089~~~
But at least he has trained on Friday

1090~~~
He's an embarrassment.

1091~~~
Left Smalling exposed his red card. Idiot.

1092~~~
One of the worst 45 minutes I can remember from a United defender.

1093~~~
It's a joke the amount of times he only reacts to a player going beyond him and not being ofside until the ball is played to him. Similarly it's a joke that every throw in that gets passed back to him has to go back/risky pass as he can't move on to his left.

1094~~~
What goal?

1095~~~
There exploiting our right side so easily. Plus can someone teach him how to do a proper throw in?

1096~~~
Shit, meant the red card.

1097~~~
Like i said, he just looks at the ball. They all run behind his back as much as they want too. Time for a new RB, Clyne,  the italian guy just get someone in.

1098~~~
He really is just oblivious to things going on around him. Tbf, he is out of position. It adds to the fact however, he's no good anywhere.

1099~~~
He's been terrible but I feel a bit sorry for him. Just back from injury and thrown in at right back against the beat attacking team in the league. He's going to have a long second half.

1100~~~
He's not a defender. He's a winger with good work rate. No defensive instincts however.

1101~~~
I hope we buy a RB in jan

1102~~~
Three foul throws, too. We used to get pulled up at boys club league on a Sunday for that shit.

1103~~~
After the performance he put in at the Etihad last year, it was obvious City would target him again. They'll get plenty of joy down that side in this second half.

1104~~~
He's been shit but given he's playing out of position and coming back from injury, it's hard to blame him.

1105~~~
Trouble is he isn't even doing basic stuff right. He losses concentration, goes after the ball and leaves his position free, played city onside and his passing as we as good as the rest of the team, rubbish. They are going to continue to exploit him as our weakness and atm, it is where they clearly look there dangerous.

1106~~~
We needed one in the summer, was an obvious hole in our squad. Young quality RB's are like gold dust at the moment though.

1107~~~
He has been pretty good defensively (1vs1)

1108~~~
Agreed.

Still found time to have a rip at the ankles though!

1109~~~
I think he's had a really good game tbf. He was partially at fault for the sending off but he's taken a lot of responsibility since we've been a man down.

1110~~~
Awful first half but actually did well in the second.

1111~~~
Played really well second half in very tough circumstances. One thing you can never call into question is his work rate.

1112~~~
Was obvious our goal would come down our right. Did well at the end v Dzeko on the one on one.

1113~~~
He doesn't have the positional sense to play right back. One v one his defending is fine because of his physical attributes but it's very easy to play the ball in behind him because he doesn't track his man.

1114~~~
To be fair to him, overall, he was absolutely fantastic today. Did a great job for us and filling in for Rafa.

1115~~~
I thought he was alright. When he got forward and we desperately needed a cross into the box I hoped so much that he wouldn't...but yep, he drilled it into the defender's ankles.

1116~~~
Thought he was rubbish up until they scored - then played really well.

1117~~~
I have to say I predicted disaster from him today, but disaster came from a little to the left from him. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Valencia was quite good today, better than I expected.

1118~~~
Playing out of position in a game where we were down to ten men. I thought he had a good second half, oddly when we had 11 men he played worse, maybe getting Smalling out of the way and the composure of Carrick next to him helped Tony settle.

1119~~~
He was better when we were chasing the game but on the poor side before that.

1120~~~
Thought he did quite well, and WhoScored have him as our best player.

Moyes used to talk about him becoming a decent right back eventually (and Moyes was actually quite good at identifying talent).

I hope he does, because he's one United player I really like.

1121~~~
Yeah, he did well in the second half.

1122~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's unbelievable isn't it? He does it almost every time too. I remember what must have been his first match at RB so he had to take the throw-in and he was raising his back leg at least a foot off the ground. Has never been called for it though. Madness, simply don't understand how a professional player can't take a throw-in.

Don't even get me started on his defensive awareness, he simply doesn't have any.

1123~~~
He did towards the end but cost us twice, 1 for the sending off and 2 for the goal, he should have cleared the ball as he was closer to it not Di Maria

1124~~~
Was poor until the second half, then had some great moments where he saved us from going 2-0 down and stifled the City threat on the left hand side.

1125~~~
Had a good second half was still culpable in the goal.  If we had Rafa playing, who knows if it would've ended 0-0

1126~~~
He was one of our better players today.

1127~~~
I picked up on the foul throw thing too. Am surprised one of them didn't get picked up by the referee.

1128~~~
Yeah, he never gets caught out of position.

1129~~~
He totally froze up when the ball passed through, I would think Rafael would be less inclined to do that.

1130~~~
Valencia did not help the attack. I don't think that should be ignored. He's more comfortable in possession than either Jones or Smalling in that position, but like them doesn't offer the wingers help in attack. It's night and day difference between what he does and what Shaw and Rafael do.

1131~~~
Still no crosses into the box. Why he exists is a puzzle to both creationists and evolutionists together.

1132~~~
He's not even bothered to overlap Januzaj. fecking useless.

1133~~~
Embarrassing that we still have to play him.

1134~~~
His days as an attacker are a distant memory, but he's been very solid defensively when played there. Bolasie is a tricky player, and he didn't give him a sniff. Seems to win every one on one and every physical battle.

I prefer Rafael every day of the week, but I have no problem with Valencia standing in, from a defensive point of view.

1135~~~
This!

1136~~~
Thought he did a really good job today and was aware in his defensive display. As some already mentioned, Bolasie can be a tricky player, but he stuck close and made some really good tackles. If he can keep his concentration up like he did today, he is a useful alternative if Rafael is out injured. He also attacked the space well today and went more centrally if his side was closed down, something I haven't seen him doing a lot over the years. Keep it up Tony!

1137~~~
Offers nothing offensively but was very solid defensively today which was what we needed.

1138~~~
He outwrestled absolutely anything on the pitch today... good to see him doing good defending, shame he doesn't offer as much going forward.. he showed glimpses but shaw looked much more threatening.. anyway I am still waiting for another loss of concentration when he gets caught out of position.. but certainly gets better and looks like good squad player to have. Him and Fellaini would certainly be two scary soldiers as their physical presence is felt although valencia is more of a rambo..

1139~~~
Did really well today, especially at moving with the ball up the pitch to close the gap in midfield.

1140~~~
He's no Rafael in terms of attacking but been a solid backup these games.

1141~~~
Never understood the criticism of him as a right back. Certainly not top class there but more than decent. Been saying it for years but I'd like to see more of him in CM too. Strong, quick and aggressive in the tackle, rarely loses possession, powerful shot - surely a handy option.

1142~~~
Its because he tends to fall asleep sometimes, credit where credit is due it was a good performance. Dont be too surprised if he loses concentration at the worst possible time.

1143~~~
One of our best players today. Matched Shaw's contribution on the other flank defensively.

1144~~~
Very good today(CP home).. Didn't lose a meaningful battle and very sharp with his passing. Obviously when Rafa gets back he'll start from the bench but hopefully he can produce more of these kind of performances. Maybe at RB he can stay here a longer time..

1145~~~
I disagree with the notion that he's a good defender, Smalling got sent off literally last week, trying to bail him out from bad positioning. He doesn't really have defensive instincts and is prone to switching off. He had a bit of spell last season where he was costing us goals at RB, off the top of my head vs Chelsea away and vs Everton home. He's also a bit too rash in the tackle and gives away too many free kicks coming through the back of players.

To be fair, full back is one of the hardest positions on the pitch to get the positioning spot on, and you can't really blame him since he's only played there part time. He was good today defensively, mainly because Bolasie tried to run/outmuscle him, and you can't out-Valencia our Tony. But when he comes up against cuter movement, overlapping full backs etc, it's a different story.

Going forward he is still frustrating. As crap as Januzaj was today, he wasn't helped by the fact that Valencia didn't make a single overlapping run. He's clearly got some serious confidence issues, because he can go past players with ease around the halfway line but when it comes to taking on his man in the final third he is awful, and has been awful for almost three years.

Rafael is better both going forward and defensively - who would have thought that in 2012.

1146~~~
He had a good game defensively because they did absolutely feck all to give Bolasie as chance to square up to him, I can recall may be 3 balls played into that side and all aerial. Valencia had some good moments in the 2nd half when he took on some runs and advanced the ball really well into the attacking zones so that's a positive. If we're going to find a new position for him, it has to be as a central midfielder.

1147~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Both of them (Title)!

1148~~~
Very valuable player. Didn't disgrace himself at CM either. Works hard for the team with little fuss being moved around. Good squad player to have.

1149~~~
Every game he plays as fullback he understands the position better and better. Developing into a very solid defender and we need as many of them as we can get right now.

1150~~~
His transformation from winger, to defensive winger, to defender is almost complete.

He doesn't even try and hide the fact he doesn't want to attack anymore.

1151~~~
Except when he attacked, anyway.

1152~~~
I agree.
The way van Gaal has used him so far is spot on imo. One of the few positives this season is that Valencia seems to get better again. In that central role he played he looked good as well.
He's no winger anymore, that much is clear though.

1153~~~
Thought he was really solid defensively. For a winger though he offers zilch going forward.

1154~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1155~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1156~~~
I think half his problem is that he's clearly a gym addict and is carrying about a stone too much weight in muscle. It makes him clumsy as hell and takes away any agility he used to have. He's still got an impressive top speed but he's sluggish as hell when it comes to accelerating and changing his pace.

1157~~~
Looks the same size he always was. Been built like a brick shit-house since his Wigan days.

1158~~~
My iPhone Cut/Copy/Paste is totally screwed with iOS 8 so I can't paste any images here hit I just searched his Wigan days and his 09/10 season with us and there's no doubt he's bulked up more. Absolutely no doubt. His top half is much thicker, his chest and shoulders have gained a few inches. I'm obviously not saying he's unfit or out of shape like people periodically moan at Rooney for being. I just think that for the position he plays its not optimum to carry that extra muscle. He could lose half a stone in muscle mass and he'd improve his agility loads and with it his attacking game.

1159~~~
Had a "good game defensively" yesterday because he had nobody attacking him the entire game, he had virtually no defending to do for 90 minutes.

othet than a couple of runs forward which ended in nothing he didn't do a great deal offensively either, he was just there on the pitch making the numbers up.

1160~~~
Yet somehow won 9 tackles.

See if you can find another United defender, in another game this season, who won more than that.

1161~~~
It does look like any future he has with the club is going to be based on his defensive abilities rather than attacking. Of course he'll still be an attacking outlet (of sorts) but his best performances this season have come in CM and RB, where his strength and ability to win the ball have been important. He's no longer much of a threat as a winger, but I think he does have value as a defensive option.

1162~~~
Did well against Palace's best player. Was also decent in the City match and not more can be expected more of our 2nd choice right back.

1163~~~
Plus did very well in midfield against Everton, so there's more to him than just being a reserve fullback.

1164~~~
Forgot about that Everton match. With all the injuries around, he's a great boost for us right now. Might get stick for this but I'm not sure if Rafael would've fared any better defensively than Valencia against Bolasie yesterday.

1165~~~
Definitely possible. 9 succesful tackles (out of 10) is a crazy good stat. Most I've ever seen.

1166~~~
How many blocks, interceptions, aerial duels and clearances did he make?

1167~~~
Probably very few as very few were needed. We did most of our defending high up the pitch.

Won more aerial duels and same amount of blocks as Rafael did against Chelsea fwiw.

1168~~~
This is going to be another one of those 7 goals in 7 starts bullshit statistics that gets repeated adinfinitum.

1169~~~
You should probably look at what the other defenders where doing, as they all seemed to manage to make some yesterday.

1170~~~
You should read the edit to my last post.

1171~~~
Huh?

1172~~~
Agree with Pogue, he did well enough & I really liked him in midfield too. Wouldn't mind seeing him there now and again when Rafael is back.

1173~~~
Valencia is a decent player, and one we should hold to. Gets a hell of a lot of unfair criticism.

1174~~~
He can definitely have a role as a squad player, mainly a RB.

1175~~~
Liked his use of strength and aggressiveness yesterday. Always was on his winger's back pushing him and tackling him in order to get back possession.

1176~~~
Amazing how he can put half a performance in and get so much praise. Seriously, a decent defensive performance against a one dimensional opponent isn't anything to write home about. He's gone from one of the best wingers in the league to being worse going forward than any of our full backs. And he's still shown plenty of brain farts in his defensive game which have cost us goals in the recent past.

1177~~~
Oh dear......

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/manchester-united-fans-have-a-lot-of-questions-for-valencia-and-theyre-all-about-the-same-thing/2706" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/ma...ncia-and-theyre-all-about-the-same-thing/2706</a>

1178~~~
Cannot get my head around Manchester United fans being c<span style="color: #000000">u</span>nts to Manchester United players on Twitter. Are they trying to impress their mates or something? Are their mates actually impressed?!

1179~~~
It's a current trend, that seems to have exploded. Not just with United, but with almost everything and everyone on Twitter

1180~~~
This. They should stop calling themselves supporters immediately. I think some have misinterpreted that word completely.

1181~~~
People actually seem to think that it's OK to be a cnut on the Internet. Freedom of speech and all that...

1182~~~
The only time it's actually funny is with Gary Lineker <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> But that's not abuse. 
99% of the time, it's just pathetic

1183~~~
Hehe, it can be funny, and I myself am probably guilty of doing it on occasion. However, using groups on Facebook to talk shit about teachers/police/doctors etc instead of having the guts to tell them to their faces is pathetic. Twitter, to me, seems like imbecile paradise at times.

1184~~~
Shat on pitch <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

But yes, agreed

1185~~~
If we revert back to the diamond I am excited about him, in the diamond you need a player that can perform out wide but also play central midfield in a 3 man midfield, I think Valencia will do fantastic in this position with Rafael at right back.

I'm actually in favour of moving Wayne up top and putting Herrera number 10 with Valencia RCM in a diamond after the Arsenal game.

1186~~~
Really?  Who drops out then?

1187~~~
It's pretty much 2015 and people are "excited" to see him play?

1188~~~
Confess - I had started to type my question(s) and then backed out knowing the poor guy is going to get the same thing ad nauseum. The questions aren't wrong in themselves but, definitely not nice if that's all he got.

I really would like him to answer why he stopped attacking defenders the way he used to and why he almost always chooses to smash crosses - almost because the other day did see him try shape one but, didn't come off.

1189~~~
Well it would be more of a trial than anything else, he has potential in that position but until it's actualised you cannot start him permanently. I am excited to see him there that's all, if Falcao or RVP are unavailable or not scoring then it is an option. 

RVP has scored 3 in 8 so far that's 0.38 goals per game, last season Moyes had him at 0.64, that's what we should be expecting from our strikers.

1190~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I feel depressed when I see him in the lineup.

1191~~~
What the hell happened to him, he has turned to pure muck

1192~~~
What the hell people??  We was solid and could actually keep the ball when pressured.. Also was able to keep his pace from start to finish.  Not buying your negativity here, folks..

1193~~~
Absolutely fantastic today. And his trademark smash finally payed off! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1194~~~
He cleared the ball with the outside of his right foot while facing his own goal. That was pure genius

1195~~~
Have to say he's been pretty bloody good at RB. By good I mean much better than expected.

1196~~~
Solid and dependable as always. Moving into a fullback position seems to be a reasonably good move for him after losing his ability to cross the ball.

His industry, strength and toughness on the right flank is so useful especially in the big matches.

1197~~~
A stupid thing to point out I know but I don't know whats worse, his crosses or his throw-ins. How referees don't pick up on his foul throws I've no idea.

1198~~~
Thought he was pretty good today, made some good tackles late on.

1199~~~
The wing-back positions suits him perfectly. He's good enough defensively (not quite good enough to be a RB), he has the strength, pace and, stamina, he's tidy enough in possession, and he joins the attack well but isn't relied upon to create or score. A very solid performance today.

1200~~~
Yup same with Young.

1201~~~
He was pretty good today.

Fellaini, Valencia, Young and Smalling all performed well today. RedCafe must be gutted.

1202~~~
I thought he did a great job shutting down that right flank for us. We already know his strengths as a footballer which can be very useful in games like this. His attacking threat has diminished but there's clearly a time and a place for him being so workmanlike.   

Well it's about time those ended up in the net again. By any means necessary.

1203~~~
Very good. Was much more aware of the space around him when defending than usual, very good to see. And yes, pleased his low cross thing finally worked but to be fair, it was the right thing to do in that scenario, so well done.

1204~~~
Finally he has perfected the art of smashing his crosses at the defenders ankle.

1205~~~
Prefer him as an out and out RB where we don't need him to try and attack, he's doing a job for now though.

1206~~~
A formidable asset in games like that. Was one moment late on when he sprinted like mad, nicked the ball and played it to Rooney who ended up stuttering and smashing it at Wilson. Good performance from him, bar the first 20-30 of the first half where everyone was below par.

1207~~~
Good player to have in the squad and doing a good job in Rafael absence

1208~~~
An actual, real life, really good performance from him (bar the first 20/25 like everyone else).... crazy.

1209~~~
He did a good job on that right hand side today. That wing back role suits him as he has got the stamina to go up and down that line.

1210~~~
Thats the best he's played at right back by an absolute mile.

1211~~~
He was solid. If he can keep this up then it'd really help us with the RB problem when Rafa is injured. I have no idea how he doesn't get picked up for foul throws though. Someone needs to have a word to him about them.

1212~~~
Thought I was seeing things because I kept noticing that too. He had a really, really blatant one in the second half where one of his feet was clearly off the ground.

1213~~~
I couldn't help laughing on one of those foul throws. It might have been the worst I've ever seen (aside from where the ball slips out of tha taker's hands)

1214~~~
I remember that one and thinking how on earth did he get away with it.

1215~~~
I'm 99% certain that refs have been told off the record to ignore foul throws unless an advantage has been gained from it i.e a really big throw or quickly taken. Let's be honest, throw ins are such an insignificant part of the game, it's just spoils the game calling a pro back for a "foul throw". 

Even when you were playing u11's it was just a bloody nuisance when some pedantic ref would call them despite no actual advantage being made from it.

1216~~~
Tony is one of the players in the team that will never give up or stop fighting, when United are dominating teams and playing pretty football he is useless tbf but when you need to scrap and fight for the points Tony never lets you down.

1217~~~
I just can't get over his throw-ins. His back leg was a good foot off the ground and he never gets called on it. It just boggles the mind that the ref, commentators and apparently our staff have never noticed it.

1218~~~
Pretty much. It plays to his strengths better than the right sided role either side. Stamina, workrate, if he could only learn to track his bloody man he might be of some use.

1219~~~
Yeah that one was so obvious and yet the commentary team didn't say anything. As Pexbo said, officials seem to just be ignoring them.

1220~~~
I'm a bit shocked a our match ratings of toni today, personally I thought he was great today. I'd say motm (I know most went ddg, but most of it was at him) 

In the second half especially he was breaking down arsenal moves in dangerous areas and his release of the ball was hard to fault

1221~~~
Our first goal came from telling contributions from the 3 most maligned players of last season. Young, Fellaini and Valencia.

1222~~~
Valencia was excellent defensively, but that goal was ridiculously fortunate. If it doesnt hit Gibbs, it goes out for am Arsenal throw in. I assume Rafael has his place back as soon as he's fit again.

1223~~~
He is a very good player to have around. Most want a Di Maria (a star) in every position but that's not possible. Valencia is miles of where he used to be when he was a beast of a winger. But what a squad player to have a cracking option.

1224~~~
In fairness to him, he's not let us down in any of his performances this season, last year he was consistently ballsing up at right back and costing us, but no gaffs so far so fair play to him, Young did well today I thought also.

1225~~~
You need to watch the goal again. Rooney was in terrific position after Gibbs. There's no way you can claim with certainty that it was going for an Arsenal thrown in.
<a class="externalLink" href="https://mediacru.sh/_kSkjU2pcDQ0" target="_blank">https://mediacru.sh/_kSkjU2pcDQ0</a>

People will say anything here to discredit what Tony or Fellaini does

1226~~~
Along with Young, he played that wing-back position brilliantly.

Suits him down to the ground. A great player to have.

1227~~~
Someone please reset his PS4 controller at half time as it seems the left stick is jammed, he needs to start offering an overlap for Fellaini or Herrera to play him in instead of stopping our attack every time the ball comes to him.

1228~~~
Gone very unnoticed so far this season but he is hugely improved from the last 2 seasons. Isn't the brilliant winger he once was but he's a very useful player to have and is performing very well every time he's on the pitch. Same with Young. Nobody can have any complaints about either of them really this season.

1229~~~
I think it was clear him and Young were instructed NOT to go forward much.

1230~~~
Thought he did very well today again. Almost never gets beaten one on one, almost never loses possession, not far off winning a penalty with a great run...pretty decent traits for a full back / wing back.

1231~~~
That's what it seemed like. I had no issue in them both playing it safe.They both did so very well. 

It seemed clear that the instruction for the entire team was ball retention. Last thing we needed was Valencia having a run, getting tackled and Hull going at it on the counter.

Pleased with his performances as a relatively un-glamorous wing back. Defensively strong and excellent ball retention.

1232~~~
We have enough talent through the middle that we don't need to overrely on the wings the way we had in recent years. Lets them both play within themselves and help out rather than be the focal point in creating chances. Can't wait to have Rafael and Shaw back but with the run of fixtures we have, Valencia and Young should be able to keep it up.

1233~~~
Another solid performance which is a good thing. Definitely get more going forward out of Rafael though. Although having a solid back-up is nice. Might save us some transfer money too.

1234~~~
I think Rafael might have trouble getting back in the team if he carries on like this.

1235~~~
I don't think so. Rafael is much better going forward.

1236~~~
Yeah Rafael has him covered pretty comfortably I think. However we all know Rafael probably won't last more than 3 matches unfortunately so it's not like Valencia will be out of the team for long.

1237~~~
I'd be interested to know which United player had the most touches in that game. Seemed like everything would go through Valencia...

1238~~~
.....but a total liability defensively, tony V is actually a better defender than rafa IMO

1239~~~
Not even close.

1240~~~
Um yeh, no.

1241~~~
You remind me of a person I spoke to in 2010.

1242~~~
Tony V the better defender? He's doing a decent job right now but people really are quick to change their mind, arent they? Rafael is the much better defender and RB

1243~~~
No, he really isn't. 

You are probably still thinking of the Rafael that played for us a season after the Neviller retired.

1244~~~
I like the player performance stuff at the top of these threads. Valencia's 5.3 rating is a disgrace, mind you.

Been a versatile, reliable and consistent performer for us this season. I'd still pick a fully fit Rafael ahead of him but it's great to have a player who can do such a solid job at fullback when needed, as well as provide cover for at least two other positions.

1245~~~
It's the one player thread that my average rating is way different to the Cafe average. Mine is 6.3; whilst the average is 5.3

I am not his biggest fan but he's performed well at right back this season and is starting to prove a more than adequate second choice RB.

1246~~~
Good man yourself. We all have players that - for whatever reason - we don't rate very highly but it boils my piss when these prejudices are so strong that we can't see past them to acknowledge good performances when they happen.

1247~~~
On that note, these player ratings things should be banned until 24 hrs after the game to prevent rage voting if you want a reasonably accurate picture. Some of the rating averages are inexplicable.

1248~~~
The CAF rating is pretty irrelevant anyway by themselves - I'd rather a comparison of these user ratings vs statistical impact from fourfourtwo, squawka or whoscored. For the most part they'll only tell you who the scapegoats are.

AV's done very well and each game he's improved at RB - I no longer see the constant ball-watching that marked him out as a poorly converted rightback and right now he is doing a good job while Rafael is out. Still I'd like to see Rafael freaking fit for at least 6 games running! AV had a great game the first time Herrera got injured doing the shuttling role int eh diamon and I prefer him there (as back up to Aner) where his pressing and pace are useful..AND any ballwatching that may return to his game will have less impact.

1249~~~
I'm still yet to be convinced he can win a header. He's alright against the likes of Hull when Fellaini is in the team, but he'd be a liability on set pieces against most sides.

1250~~~
Yeah, that's a good point. He was really ropey, defensively, in his first few games at fullback but seems to be mastering the role more and more with each game he plays. Obviously an intelligent footballer who is willing to learn. Something Van Gaal will definitely appreciate.

1251~~~
Just so long as he's not instructed to man mark Drogba...

1252~~~
Not enough left-footers for van Gaal?

1253~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1254~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1255~~~
I don't think Tony gets enough praise, in my opinion. I know he hasn't been the same Valencia of a few years ago, but he just gets on with things, never moans, and always gives 110%, which is what I like to see from the players. Great professional, and an important member to the squad.

1256~~~
Never understood the hatred for him, always seemed like a decent winger and a good back up right back to have. Somehow people expect him to be like Messi or something.

1257~~~
His crossing is the only thing that is lacking now. The amount of potential counter attacks we could have when Tony brilliantly nicks the ball and gets on his bike... 

His positioning on corners is the best man management I have seen from LVG so far. Sits on the halfway line and because of his defensive ability and pace, he's always first to the ball when the opposition clear it out. Actually superb from LVG.

1258~~~
I saw a chart of the average positions of everyone, and everything was shifted over to the right flank predominantly. Carrick had by far the most touches though, at like 125.

1259~~~
he's fine as a backup for rafa, but he should not be counted to do anything else.

1260~~~
Or just the old Valencia.

1261~~~
I might be responsible. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>
My grades do not reflects what i think overall. Except for Evans.

1262~~~
This is about right.  I think of Valencia as a more athletic version of O'Shea, able to be slotted in almost anywhere there's a pressing need due to an injury or suspension crisis.  

One thing I'd really like Tony to work on stop smashing the ball into the ankles of defenders.  Other than that, no serious complaints from me on Valencia as a solid squad man.

1263~~~
He can also do a job in midfield if we're on our last legs, as seen against Everton, where I thought he had a really good game.

1264~~~
I personally think that this has nothing to do with Van Gaal for reasons that I will outline below. In my theory, Antonio Valencia has an identical twin brother who is left footed and just as good at football but opposite in terms of his personality and crucially, he never quite got the breaks that Antonio got.  His brother may well have murdered poor Antonio one day in a fit of jealousy because of Antonio's blossoming career in football that had now found him loved by millions around the world and earning loads of money at Manchester United... to cover up the murder, and to live the life he always craved, he took his brothers identity. The only problem for him was that in order to make sure no one became wise of his ruse, he had to play as a completely right footed footballer just as his brother did. This was not an easy task for him and he never quite managed to become focus of the adulation that his late brother had received. The keen eyed among us can see it occasionally, when "Antonio" forgets that he's meant to be right footed for a fleeting moment....

1265~~~
He's (imo) better there than Rb. Probably due to him playing there several times for Ecuador during their last qualifying campaign.

1266~~~
Him and foul throws <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1267~~~
I think he's genuinely half retarded

1268~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> yeah, let's discuss the throw-ins. Spazzers.

Another good performance. With added attacking edge.

1269~~~
He played well today

1270~~~
His crossing is still shite.

1271~~~
I thought he did good today, ran past players, even had a couple of good crosses.

1272~~~
Need to see replays but looked like Van Persie and Falcao both missed very presentable chances from Valencia crosses.

1273~~~
Ya he played well big improvement on last season. But a professional footballer who often plays right back for Manchester Utd and cannot throw a ball is baffling.

1274~~~
They were bullets. I think Valencia was adequate going forward, but poor moving forward. A squad player, namely Rafael's backup at most.

1275~~~
Terrible crosses and still can't take a throw-in. Did OK apart from that though.

1276~~~
He fizzes crosses in without really looking where our strikers are. It's more pot luck than anything if someone can get on the end of those. What happened to those decent crosses of 09/10...

1277~~~
I thought the second half was the best half he's played in a dogs age as far as attacking goes, he looked to have some old spark back when he got one on one with the opposite FB.

1278~~~
Did well, he probably knows he can become first choice right-back, for this season at least.

1279~~~
Solid again. Doing well. Was a matter of time before he got pulled up for his throwing but oh well.

1280~~~
Another good outing for Valencia at right back. Someone you can always rely on to get the job done.

1281~~~
It is weird, I'll give you that!

1282~~~
Not to put a dampener on things but, him beating Pieters a couple of times was probably down to the fact Pieters was carrying a knock. Maybe he recovered from it, though.

1283~~~
Ugh, he should have found RVP in the 90th minute, free run at goal from the half way line.

1284~~~
His best game in a long time, that. Defended well and actually committed the opposition defender for a change. More of that please.

1285~~~
With the way Valencia has and is playing Rafael has a long wait on the sidelines.

1286~~~
No chance. Rafael is a lot better at RB and better going forward than Valencia.

1287~~~
Also Valencia has mastered the art of knocking the ball way too far ahead of him and running into a player to win a free-kick.

1288~~~

1289~~~
Him and Young are better as a full backs than as a wingers

1290~~~
Agreed. He had a good game last night - even looked magnificently composed when they broke out following our corner and was left as last man when he intercepted and turned effortlessly away from trouble and started our move back into their area again.

1291~~~
I haven't seen him beat a defender like he did yesterday since 2011/12.

1292~~~
I still hope United are looking for a new RB, but Valencia is doing pretty well do far.

1293~~~
Great to see him drop the shoulder and move forward with pace again at times.

1294~~~
Did well. Both he and Young do a good job even though they are no defenders

1295~~~
I wish he would learn how to take a throw-in. It sounds ridiculous but that one he got called up on (which he does every game) was when we had a throw deep in Stoke's half and could have relieved some pressure by keeping it there but they got the throw instead and came straight up the other end on the attack. It baffling really.

1296~~~
It helps when RvP stands on the defenders leg first.

1297~~~
Wonders do happen - I saw him pass the ball with his left foot yesterday, and against Hull! 

Also, discussions about him having lost pace should probably be over, right? His pace when running through their defense a couple of times was Bale-esque.

1298~~~
I'd love a gif of that burst of pace in the 2nd half into the penalty box with the fantastic cross that went across the face of goal following it. It was classic Valencia, really good to see.

1299~~~
A gif of that would be most welcome. Olly?

1300~~~
Ermmm....No!

1301~~~
About time he got called for a foul throw-in. Hopefully someone takes him aside and tells him how to do it now. Oddly enough the one he got called for wasn't half as noticeable as some of his others either.

1302~~~
Not our only poor player by any means, but he needs to start doing more than passing it sideways/backwards. This is embarrassing

1303~~~
Needs to get forwards more. Too much respect for soton and mane.

1304~~~
He's such a coward. Please Rafael stay fit.

1305~~~
Still can't throw a ball!

1306~~~
Christ, he's annoying me. What does he actually do? When we're defending he's not even in the picture half the time, because he's wandered off and is marking some grass somewhere else on the pitch. He doesn't offer anything going forward (Rooney had a right moan about it during second half) and when he finally does it takes him absolute ages to get back. No sense of urgency whatsoever. In defence, he's never actually marking anyone. He's just running around randomly and passing his man on to the nearest United player. I actually believe that he's a big part of the reason our defence looks unorganised at times, because whoever comes out as cover (which is very much needed) more often than not actually ends up marking the man while Valencia wanders off.

1307~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1308~~~
Hopefully he's close to the door.

1309~~~
He never takes on the defender, ever. He doesn't even try to. The first thing on his mind is whether he should pass it sideways or backwards. Part of the reason we had nothing going forward today, our wingbacks need to drive the ball forward in this system.

1310~~~
I've called Valencia a coward many a time, spineless is probably a better word. Nothing player.

1311~~~
Lacking in confidence doesn't make you a coward. I hate the use of that word in football these days.

1312~~~
He's lacking in confidence with a long fecking time at this stage. Cowardly, nothing player.

1313~~~
Good defensively, offers little to nothing going forwards. Last match he showed his pace and skinned a couple of players. He looked to have Bertrand on his knees a couple of times, but then decided against it. Is he so terrified of making mistakes or gaping holes in defense that he is unwilling to go forwards? He doesn't even make runs in behind defenses... Do you guys remember him when he played RB behind Nani? It was unfair to the opposition; Valencia's pace and crossing from behind must have been terrifying. Now they can put up a cone in defense and put two wingers instead.

1314~~~
Is he really though?

1315~~~
Was abysmal today in my view. Did nothing to support moves going forward or on the counter. Has become an extremely timid player; we don't need that if we're to truly challenge for the title again. Would very much prefer a player that wasn't limited by his one footedness and lack of imagination.

1316~~~
I'm not even going to complain. Today is what I've come to expect from Valencia.

1317~~~
He is a right winger playing as a right back and yet he refuses to go forward. There was one passage where Fellaini expected him to be overlapping into the space but he just stayed stationary.

1318~~~
It reminds me a bit of Ultimate Team where you use a player with high pace and good defensive workrates so you play him because he will not get caught up the field. He just does... Nothing. Serious cover for Rafael is needed as we get better.

1319~~~
No, he's awful defensively.

1320~~~
Solid enough, there's no longer any point in getting frustrated with him offering zero in attack, it's like stepping into a river and being surprised when you come out wet.

1321~~~
Such a limited player. How he has been with us for such a long time, I will never know. Seemed very afraid to go forward today, even though we were playing 3 at the back and he was supposed to provide width. Very unambitious as well, I don't think he has shown any desire over the years to improve himself. He has exactly the same limitations he had years ago - shit crossing, no left foot, can't beat a defender, zero creativity, easy sideways/backward passing and no risk taking.

1322~~~
Has somebody a gif of the situation before Southhampton's goal? Valencia looked totally uninvolved like he didn't care at all. Always a few steps away from his opponent. (You can say the same about Fellaini of course.)

1323~~~
Hopefully Rafael is back soon, he's definitely a level above Valencia. However I am still comfortable with Valencia being a back-up.

1324~~~
Coward might be too strong a word but he does not take any responsibility or iniitative. Young at least will try and beat his man, get a cross in, want the ball etc. Valencia if the ball finds it way to him just reverts to the same half yard burst then smash it against the defender, if he gets that far up the pitch. If we're not winning he has no confidence to try and change the game himself, he's a passenger most of the time. When we're decimated by injuries is the only time he should be playing, he shouldn't be anywhere near our first time otherwise, he just isn't the same player he was.

1325~~~
Valencia finds it difficult playing on the outside with no other option overlapping.  When he was playing on the wing and Rafael was flying by him, it makes the defender have to make a decision.  Now when he gets the ball on the wing its up to him to beat his man or move the ball back inside.  Most defenders now know that his likely move to get by them is to hit the ball past them and try to out run them so they take it away and force him on his left where he is much less harmful.

1326~~~
He beat not just one man but two <i>and</i> fantastic cross / pass.

Louis van Gaal hypnotism.

1327~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I shall never criticize him again!

1328~~~
I welcome back 11/12 Valencia with open arms.

1329~~~
Always rated him.

1330~~~
The half-arsed Liverpool defence made that assist look more impressive than it was. Cool as a cucumber, though. Love to see that from him.

1331~~~
Fantastic contribution for the goal. Looks so much more comfortable and dangerous on the ball today in general, hopefully he keeps it up.

1332~~~
Van Gaal can make any player better.

1333~~~
I expected him to aimlessly smash the ball across the goal. I'm glad I was wrong.

1334~~~
When was the last time both he and Young got an assist in the same match? Is it a sign of the Day of Judgement?

1335~~~
Good first half, that obstruction Allen made on him cracked me up.

1336~~~
he always knows when to steal a show, MotM!

1337~~~
The Rooney assist was beautiful <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> I was on my feet just for the megs

1338~~~
Aren't you an arse. He did extremely well, no matter who played in defense. Moreno is a bit shit at the defending part though.

1339~~~
Looking a better option than Rafael lately. Taking the pressure off to get a new RB.

1340~~~
Well played so far. He looks more confident in his abilities, do that more often Valencia.

1341~~~
One of the best players on the pitch so far keep it up lad.

1342~~~
Fully expected him to smash that across goal but the assist was class.

1343~~~
One of our best players in the first half. Didn't see that coming. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1344~~~
He's grown some bollocks and found his confidence again. Hope it continues.

1345~~~
He had been saving that nutmeg for 3 years. All the useless crosses were just a decoy to build up to that one play.

1346~~~
He was Beast in that first half! Long may it continue.

1347~~~
Thought he was impressive, dominant in the first half. A real asset when he's running with the ball.

1348~~~
I think Liverpool gave us the first goal.

Do you know when you are forced to do something, you have no choice and you kind of just do it?

So you leave your work to the last day of the deadline and then it's easy to get it done or you're chased by a dog and you just run, you have no choice.

Liverpool had two players on Valencia, it looked like he actually tried to turn back but one of the opposing players cut off his route back to the keeper, he actually had no choice but to try and get past Allen, and he panicked, Valencia panicked and put it through Allen's legs.

After that he was on fire, sometimes he got overexcited but that gave him confidence.

Liverpool would have been better off just having one player come across and give him the choice to pass it back, we all know he would have done it.

1349~~~
The coaching staff should pin a picture of him megging Allen to the wall of the dressing room to keep reminding him what he's capable of. Too many times over the past two years whe's threatened to leave his poor form behind only to revert to type the next game.

1350~~~
That was brilliant for the first goal. Just utterly brilliant.

When so see he can still do that kind of stuff, it so annoying that he doesn't do it more often.

1351~~~
His best performance in 3 years.

1352~~~
I can watch the replay of the nutmeg on Allen all night long. Solid today

1353~~~
Been much better recently. I like Rafa more but Valencia is starting to look like a perfectly fine no. 2.

1354~~~
brilliant for the first goal. He has got his confidence back..beating players. I'm sure that has a lot to do with van Gaal.

1355~~~
The ballad of great Tony

1356~~~
Fantastic first half. Second was a little quieter but he was still solid defensively. 

I think the only mistake he made all game was letting Moreno in behind him, but even then he recovered well.

1357~~~
Valencia of old today, great stuff.

1358~~~
Him and Young are growing in confidence every game!! 

We actually have cover for the full back positions that we didn't know we had.

1359~~~
Absolutely brilliant. Been disappointed in him for a long time and he was just fantastic tonight. If it wasn't De Gea, he would have easily been my MOTM. Extremely happy with him.

1360~~~
Good stuff from Tony. He has been a good backup at RB and is a bit better on the attack side than Rafa.

1361~~~
I can never criticise him ever again after that piece of sublime skill that led to the first goal. Seriously though I thought he was brilliant again today. Played well defensively and ripped Liverpool apart down the right hand side all afternoon.

1362~~~
Really impressed with him recently.

He looks defensively solid, which he hasn't done in the past when SAF used to play him at right back. 

I think Rafael will do well to get back in the team with Valencia in the kind of form he's in.

1363~~~
He seems to have rediscovered a bit of his old attacking verve today which was great to see.

1364~~~
Glimpses of Valencia of old and it's great to see.

1365~~~
I thought he was great today, and some of his runs were really exciting to see.  I actually voted him MOTM (although it's clearly De Gea) because I liked the improvement.

1366~~~
His best piece of attacking play in 2 years and an all round good performance.

1367~~~
That was the Valencia I was once a huge fan of. A good performance and just like with Young we'll hopefully see more of those.

1368~~~
This is why I always say it's great to have a Valencia type player in your team. Nothing fancy, but more often than not, gets the job done and gives 100%. 

Thought he had a great game today, and thought his run and assist to Rooney was brilliant for our first goal.

1369~~~
He's taking people on again, finally. He has the ability and the pace/power for it so it's frustrating when he refuses to do so.

I'd rather he lost the ball the odd time taking people on than kept possession always by just passing to the nearest player. Much better that way.

1370~~~
I'm very very happy with his performance lately, today included. Can't wait for him and Rafael to reignite their link-up soon

1371~~~
Taking on people is the thing we want to see. Whilst predictable he will run at people and try get it onto his right foot all the time, its his best trick and is hard to defend when hes at full pace. His assist for the first goal was fantastic.

What our strikers need to learn is when hes got the ball on the wing, run to the front post and you will most likely get a goal (opposite to when Young has it on the left, cuts in on his right to cross)

1372~~~
It won't be a popular opinion here but Rafael will need to work hard to reclaim his position back. So defensively solid and good attacking wise.

1373~~~
He showed and proved that he has a future here. He also does well as a RB which is good to see

1374~~~
He's finally got his camera back.

1375~~~
He beat his man and then got his head up and produced a good cross. Is it 2011?

1376~~~
He rolled back the years today. Looked like the man we signed in 2009 going forward, plus put in a great shift defensively. Delighted for him.

1377~~~
Keep him as a full back if Rafa's injured.

Did really well today. I think if you're looking for someone offensive on the RW he's not the guy anymore but as a offensive RB to sub in for Rafa. Not doing too bad atm.

1378~~~
I've said it once, I'll say it again... He's been better than Rafael this season and deserves to be first choice for the time being.

1379~~~
Has come good offensively again our Tony.
Looked suspicious defensively at times though. Positionally that is.

1380~~~
Been saying this for a while. Make Rafael fight to get back in the side and prove his fitness, gives Tony the confidence by saying "you're first choice, keep it up".

1381~~~
I think Rafael's generally been decent when he's played, but in this current system I wouldn't begrudge continuing with Valencia due to how well he's been playing. Was very good in attack and defence.

1382~~~
Has been excellent. looks to have his confidence back

1383~~~
Classic Valencia today. Excellent all around performance. He's great at winning the ball back and keeping hold of it when under pressure.

1384~~~
He was fantastic today. Great performance altogether and a lovely assist too.

1385~~~
A real danger going forward down that right hand side. Had me on the edge of my seat every time he moved forward because it looked like he was going to do something.

1386~~~
The thing I really like about him defensively is that no fast or quick player worries me. He has them all in his pocket for power and pace. Sterling can try as much as he likes, but there is no chance of him out-sprinting Valencia. His assist was terrific, but right after he dribbled past 4 or five Liverpool players in our own half and carried the ball through the midfield - that was some piece of skill actually. He grew in confidence today. Moreno is very fast, but Valencia gave him nothing. 

DDG was obviously motm, but Valencia (and Carrick) was great.

1387~~~
Saying he has looked better than a fit Rafael is going too far. Quality performance today though, nice to see him create something out of nothing for once.

1388~~~
He's really improving under LVG. He seems to have a better presence of mind about him and doesn't look out of ideas. Good stuff.

1389~~~
Has a horrible tendency to switch off and get caught out by diagonal balls.

That thats the only criticism I have of him is a good sign, I guess.

1390~~~
Yet another competent game as wing back.  I think it's his best position; all those games at right back have really developed his overall game.

Provides excellent options with Rafael now on that right side.  An unexpected bonus this season.  LVG due a lot of credit for getting him back to his best.

1391~~~
Fantastic performance from him, he was likely our only player other than Carrick who could string passes together even while being pressed and the nutmeg for the goal was throwback Tony V. If not for De Gea, he'd be my man of the match.

1392~~~
He's filled in brilliantly tbf for Rafa. Loved his meg on Allen for the first goal. And great to see him smiling and celebrating the goals. He's enjoying LvG's reign by the looks.

1393~~~
Will be interesting if he can play this well consistently at fullback. He did well agiast hull but they were no match for us on the day anyway, because thats how I think we'll play eventually in the long run.

1394~~~
Him and Young may well have saved their careers at United with these latest performances, happy to keep them around as backups for Shaw and Rafael.

1395~~~
LVG as a coach is perfect for someone like Valencia.  He is following instructions to a tee and seems very confident in what to do next,  a huge contrast to his constant hesitation last year

1396~~~
He even had some thoughtful crosses today where he looked up and actually tried to get under the ball and put it about headheight for people in the box. Granted they didnt work out, were generally a bit weak but its a promising sign that he's getting a clue about what to do with the ball.

Make no mistake, his set up for Rooney's goal was the worst defending you'll see all season. Confronted by 3 players, Valencia only need to beat 1 weak challenge from Allen to get free.

Having said that, its not his fault that Liverpool decided to collapse in front of him. All Valencia can do there is try and get away and he did so, then he found a teammate on the edge of the box with a pass. So credit to him for keeping his head there.

But I'm going to laugh at that one for quite a while to come

Played well today had more success than usual

1397~~~
He struggles with lifted cross it seems, but those low crosses are much more dangerous. Did well today.

1398~~~
We need to work on getting people onto them though.We've had success with lifted crosses from the left recently but the low crosses from the right are equally dangerous if our forwards start making runs towards the near post.Hernandez used to be great at that,someone else needs to take up that mantle.

1399~~~
That's correct, and I think Falcao is the one who can grab a couple of goals like that because he seems to be willing to attack the ball on the near post. It's not RvP game and Rooney seems to be playing deeper those days.

1400~~~
I like nothing more than to be wrong about a player I've had serious doubts over. 

Van Gaal has transformed him and Young.

1401~~~
Just here to apologise. Gave him some stick on Monday. Was in shock when he went past two players at once.

1402~~~
There's nothing wrong with having one move. Ask Robben. The problem is that Valencia hasn't tried to get past anyone in 2 fecking years.

I'm glad it finally happened against Liverpool and resulted in a goal.

1403~~~
He has 4 assists this season <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1404~~~
It's not only the run but the fact that he saw Rooney and passed to him. I was fully expecting him to just whip the ball in and hit the first defender.

1405~~~
Our attacks often go down his side, they just usually come to nothing when he blasts it at the defenders legs. If he actually started to pick out passes like yesterday more often he'd contribute a lot more.

1406~~~
Massive credit to Lvg for turning Young's and Valencia's career around. Both were absolute dogshite under Moyes, and in Fergie's last couple of seasons.

1407~~~
Sometimes gets a raw deal on here but final ball could be better and has played less well since the serious injury before which he was consistently excellent. Done really good yesterday - apart from losing Moreno the one time.

1408~~~
look! He can still beat defenders. Please do it more often!

1409~~~
In defense of his doubters. He did only beat Allen!

Jokes aside his contribution this season (post burnley) has been impressive

1410~~~
the 3-5-2 formation seens to help players like Young, Valencia and Fellaini. Carrick as well but iso the other im sure he would also do well in midfield when we play a back-four

1411~~~
Same as Navas. One more than Nasri. Playing mainly as a defender (Zabaleta has 2).

1412~~~
Thats very harsh mate.

1413~~~
The return of Antonio Valencia, finally

1414~~~
They were both good in Fergie's second last season, especially Valencia.

1415~~~
don't forget both do play more defensive roles than before. That Valencia could do this doesn't surprise me but Young's defensive performances have been a real surprise for me

1416~~~
I always had yer back Toni - now don't disappoint me, and keep it up!

1417~~~
I've always been an admirer of his pace and power, but does he look a little more sluggish for the first couple of yards? His top speed is still impressive, no doubt. But when he sped away from Allan, it wasn't with impressive acceleration, but perhaps he didn't need to...

1418~~~
I have always had a soft spot for him (well in the last couple of years as much a soft spot as you can have considering lots of his laughable performances) but even then out of our average players I preferred to keep him rather than some others as I refused to believe that he had completely turned into an anti footballer for ever! He had shown too many positives for United at one time to be that bad. Glad he is doing fine again. Long may it continue!

1419~~~
Even at his worst he showed a few very useful attributes. His strength, speed, stamina is all second to none, but he is also really good at keeping hold of the ball under pressure and finding a way out to relieve the pressure. He was frustrating as hell going forward the last 2 years, but he's clearly playing with a lot more confidence now and is even passing the ball with his left occasionally, something he would avoid at all costs before.

1420~~~
It's so annoying that he does it in fits and starts. He suddenly unleashes the beast and makes you think "why the hell do you not just do that normally?!". I loved that when he finally got into the box he actually picked out a runner really nicely. That was the AV25 of old, not the 1 he has regressed into.

He has been solid though at RB recently, he really does make a great wing back with his physical attributes.

1421~~~
Throwback to 2010. Valencia to Rooney for the goal.

1422~~~
If he can keep improving defensively I have no problem with him being back up right back. He has all the physical attributes.

1423~~~
what a year that was for valencia-rooney

1424~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Dec/michael-carrick-says-antonio-valencia-is-a-pure-athlete.aspx?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...=facebook&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd</a>

1425~~~
I'd quite like to see him on the right of the midfield three when Rafael returns.

1426~~~
He did sort of play that role as a RM in a diamond against Everton when Herrera was injured. Was pretty decent in that game as well.

1427~~~
Was reading an article on the Top 10 Workhorses in the PL <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.us/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2201813/top-tenner-premier-league-workhorses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.us/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2201813/top-tenner-premier-league-workhorses</a>

Was kind of expecting Valencia would be in there, can't think of anyone on the squad who works harder both defensively and offensively.

1428~~~
I wish Fellaini would start avoiding this too.

1429~~~
Me too. His lazy passing with his left foot giftet Southampton a goal and Liverpool a great chance. And he almost giftet me a heart attack in the process.

1430~~~
That's a little harsh, specially the Southampton goal. Between his stupid pass and the goal, there were many opportunities to defend better and clear the ball.

1431~~~
I think his stat of averaging just 1.1 dribble per game is still hugely dosappointing for a player with his pace and power. You could argue its playing at right back but last year he averaged exactly the same from the right wing. 

If he was more adventurous he'd be a lot more threatening and create not only a few more goals but also space for others to work with.

1432~~~
Where did you get that stat from and how does it compare with Rafael?

The closest I could find was "succesful take on" and he's 1.08/game this season, compared to Rafael's average of 1.00 last season (and 0.64 from the season before).

EDIT: Rafael's better this season mind you, with 1.17

1433~~~
Here's a Rafael vs Valencia <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2014/2015/rafael/126/126/578/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/antonio_valencia/126/126/581/0/p#successful_take_ons_%/assists/tackles_won/blocks/clearances/aerial_duels_won/pass_completion/total_score/attack_score/defence_score/possession_score#avg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stat off</a>, for the nerdily inclined.

If you ask me, they demonstrate that Rafael is the better full back but Valencia runs him impressively close.

Those that buy into the "Total", "Defence" and "Attack" scores will probably come to the opposite conclusion.

Which is definitely backed up by the overall impression he's given on the pitch. I think both Young and Valencia might just have found their best positions, strangely. Both are very hard-working, both are tactically intelligent and responsible, both fast, both decent tacklers. Neither is really a good enough attacker these days to be relied on as an offensive outlet, and neither is confident enough going forward to do much with the ball when receiving it in tight spaces or with their backs to goal. This FB/WB conversion seems to suit those conditions.

I'd like to see Shaw and Rafael in the first XI whenever they're available, but after recent showings I'm pretty happy for Valencia and Young to be their back-up.

1435~~~
Valencia has always had the ability, you don’t get player of the season at a Club like United unless you have something about you. I’ve no idea what happened to him the last couple of seasons but I believe we are finally starting to see the old Valencia. He is using his speed to take on players again and tends not to overthink things too much which was part of his problem last season.

1436~~~
There's a lot of players out there who hit a couple of years of really good form but never hit those heights again. Indeed they probably outnumber the players who manage a very high level throughout their entire careers.

Tony V has been way below par for the last couple of seasons, I think we can all agree that. So even if he gets back to average he'll be better than he has been. But I can't say Im particularly hopeful he'll ever hit those player of the year heights again. That said he may do enough to warrant his continued place in the squad though. A direct pacy winger is never a bad thing to have on the bench.

1437~~~
It's from WhoScored. 

I should add though I'm not really looking to compare him with Rafael. As you know I've been one of Valencia's harshest critics but believe it or not, I'm happy enough to admit when I'm wrong. I felt he had no future here but he's reinvented himself and I'm very pleased with him this season. 

To the point where I question if Rafael should actually come back in without Valencia losing his place through injury or a drop in form first. 

The reason I wasn't looking to compare him with those stats is that it's his own ability that I am judging him against. I still feel he's playing within himself and is too conservative in his attacking, especially when he has Fellaini on his wing who is more than capable of dropping in behind and holding ground if he should take a risk and try to go past a player or two. 

It could be though that Van Gaal has highlighted the wide areas as potential issue areas and instructions are to be conservative wide and attack through the centre which makes sense as we are better dealing with attacks centrally than we are dealing with attacks that start from wide.

1438~~~
I agree.

It’s hard to regain top form when you’ve been without it for so long, but Valencia still has the pace and with a bit of tweaking to his game I’m hoping he gets back to him old self, he’s shown more glimpses that he is on the right path this season that he has for the last two, which is encouraging.

1439~~~
In terms of performances Valencia has been refreshingly good. I generally think a player who's done well should keep their place in the team (provided their replacement isn't some world class talent). 

However I think part of the reason we're playing a 3-5-2 is because we have Valencia and/or Young in the team. Playing them as wingbacks gives them extra cover and changes the balance of their role to make them a bit more attacking and a bit less defensive. While they both work hard in defense, Shaw and Rafael will both have spent (I hope) a hell of a lot of hours as they grew up understanding how to make a back four unit work, getting an instinctive understanding for how an offside trap works etc. As good as Valencia has been, I doubt at this age he'll be able to learn that.

So even though I think its harsh, I'd personally swap Valencia for Rafael if it allowed us to go to a back 4, as it seems to suit our other personnel better.

1440~~~
Yup. Same here.

Valencia's been great but still doesn't have the defensive instincts of a fullback, as you say. These was horribly apparent in his first few cracks at the position (often costing us goals) but does seem to be improving. Obviously not to an extent where Van Gaal will trust him in a back four though and if I don't get anything else for Christmas, I hope I get to see Manchester United playing with 4 at the back. If this means taking Antonio out of the team, so be it.

1441~~~
I blame the shirt number change <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1442~~~
Haven't seen the stats but Rafa is better going forward, there's not much doubt about that in my view. The way he links up (with Herrera) and his intelligence is generally better than Valencia.

1443~~~
Dunno about that. It's certainly based on very little evidence. How many games have Rafael and Herrera played together?

It's funny actually, the one United player Rafael seems to have had the best understanding with is Valencia himself. Even when Valencia lost his mojo as an attacking force completely, his link up play with Rafael was very good. I wonder if thye'll ever play in the same team again?

1444~~~
*nods*  our best right side the past 4-5 years have included the two of them from when Valencia was on form to the less adventurous safety first guy we've seen since 2012.

1445~~~
The QPR game there was fantastic chemistry between Rafa and Herrera. 

Rafa's work is better off the ball than Valencia's and both Herrera and Rafa were looking to make both penetrative runs and ghost runs, not only creating space for each other but also dragging the opposition wide and creating space for Van Persie and Mata to operate around the area. 

With that sort of panic and attention on that side of the field it in turn made space for Di Maria and Rooney to work the left channel with Daley Blind doing a good job of switching the play that day. 

Again against West Ham they linked up well, this time Herrera would drift across their area as they were stretched by Rafa and he used the space to link well with Rooney around the area. 

Valencia and Fellaini have been really solid on that side but it hasn't been nearly as dynamic.

1446~~~
I wouldn't say there was much understanding between Rafa and Valencia. Their understanding mainly involved one of them overlapping the other and whipping in a cross. Not bad (and effective at certain times) but nothing like the link up play Herrera and Rafa have shown. The sameple is is certainly a lot lesser though.

1447~~~
You're comparing one game against a very accommodating QPR team to several years including 2 titles with AV + Rafa... your sample size is possibly inadequate.

1448~~~
I'm comparing two games. The West Ham game was the second one of you read the whole post. 

While it's still a small sample size there was a huge amount of positives to be taken from them. 

It's all well and good citing the years Rafa and Valencia have played together but don't pretend they were all excellent. For 2 1/2 of those years Valencia was dreadful. Truely awful. Just because Rafael was the player to brin out the best in him doesn't mean it was good enough. Those two matches showed a real understanding between Herrera and Rafael and that's what Pogue was asking.

1449~~~
As you yourself just admitted there isn't enough evidence. Herrera never played wide right either - he was central right as the shuttler. The one game Valencia played that role (right after Herrera's back fracture) he had a good game. You have to compare apples to oranges. Herrera has never played as a right winger for us in the few months he's been here.

So I'm not sure why Rafael's understanding with Ander as <b>a midfielder</b> is being compared to that he has with Antonio <b>as a winger</b>. 

And your definition of excellent is not the barometer. AV + Rafa were part of a solid right side. Annually as AV (for whatever reason, #7 vs #25,  Moyes) became less adventurous, Rafael became more so and they were as effective as a pair - its a team game, and the only one who suffered for their combo was Nani (who played left or was injured on the bench.. or during Moyes reign ignored for Young wide left). The team benefited as the number of titles proves during the last 5 years.

1450~~~
Even at his worst, Valencia consistently linked up very well with his team mates. The frustration of fans was down to his poor final ball and general conservatism. When it came to intelligent link up play, he was consistently very good.

This sort of thing.

All the above from one of those "truely awful" seasons you refer to.

Absurdly small sample size aside, I don't see how a discussion about Rafael and Hererra linking up well together (compared to Fellaini and Valencia) is any use in comparing the attributes of the two full-backs. Not unless you can mention games where Valencia played ahead of Hererra and they failed as a partnership?

1451~~~
To be honest, I was just answering your question about how well Herrera and Rafael have linked up. It wasn't me that said it was better than Valencia and Rafael. However I stand by the fact that the only evidence we have, those two games, was highly encouraging. They were dynamic and as I said above, their linking up caused real panic in QPR and West Ham's defence.

1452~~~
I don't even think we're disagreeing! I would have Rafael as the better fullback, both going forwards and in defence. So in a hypothetical scenario where Valencia <i>did</i> play ahead of Hererra it's quite possible he might not look as dangerous as Rafael did.

I was just objecting to this statement "<b>The way he links up (with Herrera) and his intelligence is generally better than Valencia</b>". I think Rafael is a better dribbler, plays with more flair than Valencia and his final ball is better (over the last couple of seasons, anyway) so he's more of an attacking threat. When it comes to intelligence (in a footballing sense) there are few players smarter than Valencia and it's not one of the main adjectives I'd associate with Rafael, that's for sure!

1453~~~
Sorry I was thinking of Valencia ahead of Rafael vs Herrera ahead of Rafael rather than Rafael with Herrera ahead vs Valencia with Herrera ahead. 


And that's unreadable but the jist is there.

1454~~~
Valencia's football intelligence is practically zero or has been for the last 2 and bit seasons. Unless repeatedly trying to break a full back's legs is called intelligence.

Anyway, Pexbo summed it up better. Intelligence was probably the wrong word on my part. The link up between Rafa and Valencia was bog standard link up play between a full back and winger and usually maksed how shite Valencia was. Herrera and Rafael have shown a lot more so far ansd could do a lot better given a run together. However, one is always injured and the other will probably end up in jail so this conversation is probably pointless.

1455~~~
Obviously, there's more to being an intelligent footballer than the choice of final ball. You're wrong about "bog standard" too but meh, opinions.

1456~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> it really is!

1457~~~
Whike it was still only two games, I think there was a lot more guile in the play between Rafa and Herrera than we see from Valencia.

Valencia is very simple in his link up play in that it consists of one twos or passes down the line.

I'll try and find Herrera's highlights from the QPR and WHU games as you'll see what I mean.

The difference between the two is that Herrera is not afraid to commit to a run that will take himself out of position and even out of the play whereas Valencia's is much more conservative and measured. He's more calculated and plays the percentages well which is probably what Pogue is referring to when he notes his intelligence. The fact is that it's almost impossible to think of a time where Valencia has left his fullback exposed. When Rafael plays with Valencia it's Rafael that is more often then not on the overlap exploiting space whereas in the games with Herrera, it was Herrera who was happy to make the run wide from a more central position (as he's a RCM not a RW) and carry a player or two with him and in turn open the inside channel up for Rafael.

On the flip side, Herrera was also happy to start from a wider position and then play the one two with Rafael before carrying the ball centrally right across the area.


But again I'm comparing Herrera the RCM with Valencia the RWB/RW which isn't what we are currently talking about.

1458~~~
I for one am not surprised at all that Valencia is shining in his current role. He has all of the attributes to naturally be one of the best right (wing) backs in the world. Speed, power, strength, discipline and a great work ethic. His experience and even the negative of his creative limitations are bonuses for the role now too. The job of a right back is to support, do simple things well, overlap and be an option for an attack. He does this all day long.

1459~~~
It's all a bit apples and oranges because we're comparing players with different team-mates, as well as playing in different formations.

If you're playing as a full-back ahead of a conventional winger the play will end up a bit more stretched and there's more spaces to run into. Plus you're much more likely to have a man advantage at any moment.

As a wing back, in a 352 you are much less likely to have a man advantage. There's more one v ones (e.g. vs Joe Allen) but less opportunity to over-lap and be slipped clean through by a midfielder.

Rafael's never (I think?) played as wing-back so we don't know how well he'd cope in the same scenario. Valencia has played as a full-back in a back four in previous seasons but wasn't very good at all. Although it was a completely unfamiliar position at the time.

So yeah, the comparison is pointless. Valencia is clearly a very intelligent footballer, though. The type of player Rafael would enjoy playing ahead of, particularly because he has the freedom to maraud forwards in the knowledge that Valencia has got his back. That's why they have always looked like a decent partnership, even when Valencia forgot how to be a winger and all the quality attacking play down our right came from Rafael. 

Where we really looked awful, in the last couple of seasons, was when Valencia was playing ahead of Jones or Smalling. That just did not work, on any level.

1460~~~
Interestingly, for years Valencia was only in the side to play as "backup" for Nani on the right wing.  Now Valencia is playing "backup" for Rafael as wingback.  

I wouldn't want Valencia as my backup.

1461~~~
that's far from true.

1462~~~
Why does he keep turning back and passing backwards?

The one time he had a real good go we looked dangerous. Does my fecking head in because he's clearly still capable of it.

1463~~~
Honestly wont mind if he loses the ball or smashes it into someones feet. Would rather he do that than pass the ball backwards/sideways. We have two strikers that live off crosses. If he can get 1 out of 5 of them into the box we will score.

1464~~~
1. FECKING ONE FOOTED. 
1b. Easy to read. 
1c. One dimensional. 

2. Lack of confidence.

1465~~~
Thought he was alright today, Young was more dangerous on the other flank but he put in some decent deliveries. Still passes back too much and should take on the full back more, but when he did he was OK.

1466~~~
Burst past a defender, stops, then dribbles it back a bit and passes it backwards. Did that quite a bit, though he wasn't too bad. Created a few dangerous crosses here and there.

1467~~~
Only saw the 2nd half, thought he was doing fine and shouldn't have been brought off.

1468~~~
Apart from a fairly short spell, I don't think that was ever true?
Nani played out left most of the time.

1469~~~
As soon as ADM came on he just passed it him. Shame as he did well before that. Poor mentality.

1470~~~
His predictability is almost lol worthy at times. It's just the same thing over and over, rinse and repeat. He needs to be shipped on.

1471~~~
His team mates love him though.

1472~~~
I actually find this worrying

1473~~~
He was quite decent today. I was looking forward to a couple of Agbonlahor vs Valencia runs, but that never happened. He's still little timid going forwards, although he did beat his fullback quite a few times today, looks to be a little sharper off the line again. What bugs me is that he seems to have this idea that he shall not lose a race, and therefore he doesn't take on his man unless he knows he has him beaten. Several times today he was on a one on one against Sissoko. He could have tried and possibly gone past him, or he could have been stopped. Hazard, Bale, Ronaldo, Robben etc etc all lose the ball because they are stopped. Valencia isn't close to their level, so another reason why I wouldn't mind at all if he lost the ball at times in those situations. Just go for it Tony!

1474~~~
Fact is though, the wingback are ridiculously isolated on the wing. There are no overlaps - I think Valencia got one, but didn't use it. A few times, Young was isolated against three Villa players, and then they were down a man. Valencia usually had at least two men on him, left fighting for himself really. No wonder he chooses the backpass. Young was more lucky in that his fullback was so slow that he could just run past him (that was a yellow for the tackle when Young got his assist)

1475~~~
AS soon as he went off we lost all balance - individually he hasn't been very brilliant for about 3 years except in instances/games hereand there (eg Liverpool 2 years ago, chelsea the same season, earlier this season when eh was the RCM shuttler when herrera's back was damaged) but his contribution to the team dynamic is apparent especially w/o Rafael. If he had stayed on it would have allowed AY to stay left and keep terrorizing Luton. Reckon LvG was trying to give him and RvP some rest when it looked as if we had the upper hand with the man advantage - it backfired.

Where do these fans come from who don't actually watch most of our games? For years Valencia has been the starting RW and Nani was either on the LW or benched (since his injuries and Young's arrival) <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> - it's only since Moyes that Valencia has been played so often as a RB and now RWB by van Gaal. Fergie used him there only in emergencies and alternated between him Jones & Smalling.

Also Rafael has rarely played as a wingback for us - it's a different position than a rightback, though he does have the attributes to do it well either way.

1476~~~
What the hell? He was very good yesterday and taking him  and RVP off cost us all 3 points. People see what they want to see.

1477~~~
I think he was only taken off so we had more bodies up top and you wouldn't have taken Young off the way he was performing.

1478~~~
LOL - been watching almost every match and reading the Caf for the past 5 years.

If you recall at first Valencia was coming on as a sub for Nani until he won the starting role through his performances, after which Nani was either benched, injured, and sometimes but not very often played on the left.  It was during his lengthy injury spells that the Valencia thread was full of posters claiming that he was doing a job as backup until Nani's return.  But even when he returned he was usually on the bench with Young, Kagawa, Giggs or even Welbeck sometimes taking the left side of midfield.  

I liked Nani and Rafael but they are similar in that they are mercurial and hot-headed.  They can make mental mistakes that cost you a match.  For all of Tony's predictability and conservatism, managers from SAF to Moyes to LvG seem to trust him because his workrate and discipline allows the more creative players to express themselves.

1479~~~
This is the first time I saw someone defending Valencia by claiming he was back up for Nani.

1480~~~
you're literally arguing against the point you first made here.

1481~~~
Was feeling his oats today, even had a shot.

1482~~~
Apart for the Liverpool game, Young has been the better wing back but that's not to say I have a problem with him, just gets on with his defensive duties quietly and sometimes provides service for the forwards. Shocking really when you think of what he was 2-3 years ago but that's all we need him to be these days.

1483~~~
He has done a very decent job as wing back. But Young is totally out performing him

Reckon LVG likes Valencia because he has looked so disciplined

1484~~~
1000 times better than Rafael

1485~~~
Young got caught out of position a few times. Don't remember Newcastle having much joy down our right. Valencia's role seemed to be to shut down that flank... and he did it.

1486~~~
White text? Sarcasm?

1487~~~
Really impressed with Valencia lately given how poor he had become. This no frills wing back role really suits him and his pace and power is valuable to us when defending a quick counter. The more he plays the role the more his defensive awareness improves also.

It is funny really as all the top managers seem to have a lot of time for Antonio Valencia, even when he is off form. van Gaal likes him and even Guardiola spoke highly of him when we played Bayern. He also seemed to always play for Fergie even when in dire form.

1488~~~
He is a manager's dream. No agent, follows instructions, never complains, and is strong and fast and conservative with his play.

Rafael is still much better though.

1489~~~
Huge credit to him and Young. Really have turned their careers around with us.

1490~~~
He's doing alright but I would take Rafael back without question, whereas Young is at least making the manager think when Shaw is fit. Young is really taking his chance, taking on his man, putting in good crosses, showing some pace. Valencia needs to follow his lead, show more confidence.

1491~~~
When he keeps moving when he gets the ball, defenders don't know what to do with him - they'll continue to back off him. It's when he stops that he loses all effectiveness usually. Did actually get a shot on goal today and wish he'd do a bit more of that - it's there for him usually when he is more agressive.

1492~~~
One of my favourite things to witness in football is still one of Valencia's displays of his freakish strength. I swear there was one point today where one of their defenders tried to push him and ended up falling over himself... t'was hilarious.

1493~~~
what a turnaround in his form.

real happy for the lad...and for us too of course.

1494~~~
To be honest, bar the run and cutback for Rooney in the Liverpool game, he's still not contributing a great deal going forward is he? Young's whipping in quality cross one after the other, we're very reliant on him in an attacking sense it seems because there's not a lot going on down the right hand side.

1495~~~
In fairness it's very rare that both wingers/wingbacks dominate in the same game.Play tends to drift towards one side,usually Young's as he is a better crosser.Young had a n ordinary game against Liverpool because Valencia was dominating.

That said he did get a shot on target and broke free once and should have done better with the pass to RVP.There definately is more to come from him going forward but it wan't really his fault play wasn't going through him this time.

1496~~~
Much better defender than Young, and I think Valencia was better than him against both Liverpool and Villa. And Rafael and Shaw should be far away from certain starting positions (at least as long as we play with 3 CBs) because both Young and Valencia have been really solid.

1497~~~
He is showing that he is definitely capable of being a back-up to Rafael, which is a good thing.

1498~~~
He's not done anything bad but when you look at Young, you can't help but feel he should be offering a heck of a lot going forward especially a he's supposed to be a winger.

1499~~~
I read somewhere he's 30 already. Time flies

1500~~~
Solid defensively but offered nothing in attack, then got injured because we have to have at least one per game.

1501~~~
His removal disrupted our momentum significantly. We suffered a lot from the formation change. In my opinion, he kept their attack from the left very quiet. We missed his physical presence in the second half. Hope he will be fit for Stoke. Rafael will get a red card if he starts there.

1502~~~
He looked shit till he went off, when I realised that his replacement was even shittier. At least Valencia was assured defensively.

1503~~~
Bloody hell.

1504~~~
It's lacking perspective but isn't factually incorrect.

1505~~~
TBF, I love Rafael but he has too often been poor defensively for us.

1506~~~
I hope his injury is not too serious. He played well before he had to come off.

1507~~~
What many seem to take for granted is Valencia's physical presence. Pardew talked about hitting United on the counter with quick players, Gouffran being one of them. He tried several times to race down that left side but was easily outpaced by Valencia every time. Against Tottenham, they might have gone through on the counter as well down the middle had not Valencia rushed back to intercept. 

Currently, he may not offer too much going forwards, unless when forced to and then he runs past a couple of players, but his passing, retention of the ball and defensive work rate is very valuable.

1508~~~
I wish he could cross properly. More precisely, I wish he could use at least a couple of crossing techniques.

He never whips in crosses. He always blasts them into the area. When he tries to hang them up it inevitably fails. A bit annoying, because in his first couple of seasons he was a good crosser of the ball and got plenty of assists.

1509~~~
Not true. He's 29. The briefest of Google searches would have given you that information.

1510~~~
Hopefully he'll be fit for the Southampton game.

1511~~~
Yes please with our injurious and not so much with the back three and wing backs.

1512~~~
Looks like he gained a couple of cylinders to his engine and added a turbo. It's been a long time since he's looked this fast. Probably our only player looking decent tonight.

1513~~~
He must be the worse crosser of a football ever!!!!

1514~~~
I thought he did well, obviously no quality delivery but he was one of our only players who could beat a man and get us on the front foot. Did that a good 3 or 4 times to progress moves down the right

1515~~~
It stopped being funny about 3 years ago.

1516~~~
At least he has the balls to take people on again even if his crossing is still shite.

1517~~~
His delivery today was no better than Shaw on the opposite flank, but he looked far more likely to beat his man which has never been a given when we're talking about ol' Tony V. Fair play.

1518~~~
He's going past players again so that's not bad but the rest is still shite. He's set the bar so very low though that some will mistake that for a good performance.

1519~~~
The only player driving us forward for most of the game. Rafael would be getting praised for a performance like that.

1520~~~
Combination of power and speed with aggression suited for proper Man United player.

Miles better than Di Maria and Mata, today. Feckin class above.

1521~~~
Very good game today, never thought we will see this Valencia back.

1522~~~
He was good today, has started beating players again.

1523~~~
I don't understand Valencia. It's like he plays crap to troll us all, then occasionally reveals he actually can beat his man or put in a decent cross once every few games, before putting in turgid performances again.

He's been steady as a wing back, and probably prefer him to Rafa in this formation, but if he actually started pulling his finger out more often you'd have to think we would have a heck of a wing partnership with Di Maria and him and could start playing with some width again.

1524~~~
Thought he was our best player today along with Blind, crosses not always there but he got past his man a few times and set up a few chances. Nobody else had any idea what to do apart from give it to him out on the right when we were counter attacking in the second half.

1525~~~
I wasn't impressed by his performance today, he continues to frustrate me. Taking on one player then wasting his next ball doesn't count as a good performance for me. His crosses are useless, he appears to just randomly hit the ball in the box and hope for the best. This is not how you cross to your centre forwards. He frequently makes the wrong decision in the final third, he's fast on his feet but slow in every other regard, he doesn't read the game well, can't pass accurately beyond about 5 yards, can't win headers, is reluctant to shoot and I just don't see what he offers the team at all.

1526~~~
Was really good today, was probably one of our most potent threats along with Mata.

He should be first choice RB/ RWB, ahead of Rafa.

1527~~~
Good game today. He's one of the few that benefit from this wretched formation.

1528~~~
Least terrible of the lot. A good first half and an OK second half.

1529~~~
He showed real drive at times today and beat players more often than he has for a long time. I will always be at a loss to explain though how a professional footballer plying his trade at that level can be so technically deficient when it comes to crossing, especially when he has been playing as a winger for most of his career.

1530~~~
Only attacking player to do anything.

His touch is so underated.

1531~~~
It's a shame management seem to be amused!!

1532~~~
He was a good outlet down the right hand side for us again today. I think he's become less predictable than what he's shown in the past.

1533~~~
He was one of the more solid performers today - our issues dont lie AV. If your going to diss him in a paragraph, I cant wait to read the chapters you will no doubt now have to write to be considered objective in your views? Or would you rather pick on AV and ignore the real culprits behind todays defeat?

1534~~~
Exactly. Still no end product whatsoever. Pointless.

1535~~~
Felt he was our best performer today, especially in the first half.

1536~~~
This  him and Mata appear to be our only players capable of playing one touch football also. I guess once there was no Young to do the attacking he decided to do some today, but you get the feeling he's wary of leaving Jones by himself adn given how Elia beat ol' Phil a few times today you can't blame him!

1537~~~
There are other culprits. As we're in the Antonio Valencia thread I thought I'd talk about Antonio Valencia. Mainly decided to contribute due to being so bemused that people considered his performance good today. If anything it shows how low of an opinion people hold of him.

1538~~~
Was certainly encouraging to see more of the old Valencia again.

1539~~~
Maybe we should try him in the same role as against Everton in the diamond, he has the pace and engine to cover when Rafael joins attack.

1540~~~
The 2011/2012 Valencia!

1541~~~
our best player. at least he was trying to do something positive.

1542~~~
Was great to see him take players on again. Really want to see him put in these sort of performances more often. I think this is what frustrates me most about him. He showed today that he can beat and man and be positive, yet other games he is the most negative player on the park and kills off any sort of attack. Hopefully next game we see the same Valencia that turned up yesterday.

1543~~~
he can always beat players.  he just can't bloody cross or put a decent ball in which makes beating these players irrelevant. he may aswell lose the ball to them

1544~~~
My MotM. Thought he was solid. They attacked down Blackett's side a lot so he didn't do much defensively in the 2nd half but he was alright going forward. Pleased to see he actually beat his defender a few times. Deserves to keep the position from Rafael.

1545~~~
People are really overhyping his performance. That goes to show how far standards have fallen. Final product was terribly inconsistent if not piss poor (again). So he beat his man a couple times more than usual. But did we create anything of note from the right? Or from him? No. Most of the time it went like this ; ball to Val, he stands still, knocks it back, ball gets recycled to centre backs.

1546~~~
Used his left feet twice in the game.  Really a big improvement.

1547~~~
I'm not a big Valencia fan but he did well yesterday. The only player who wanted to try and beat their man to move forward instead of passing it around and going nowhere.

1548~~~
Thought he looked back to his best in parts. When he realises he is actually fast and can dribble quite well it's amazing the difference. If only he had more confidence in himself to just tear defences up he could be a great player.

1549~~~
He played very well. Especially when you consider how he was consistently 1 v 1 or even 1 v 2. This stupid poxy formation means we almost never create any overload down the flanks. Poor Luke Shaw had no idea what to do in the same situation.

1550~~~
Some players start at minus 10 in the fans mind and all objectivity about how they preform are judged by that benchmark. Sad really

1551~~~
People happy with these kind of performances just proves yet again how much standards have dropped. Blame the formation for everything seems to be the standard on here, not the lack of ability of certain squad members. Better than Shaw of course, who was dire, but feck me we miss a fit Rafael. I'm almost wanting us to buy someone like Coleman just to stop Valencia getting games.

1552~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> No.

1553~~~
Was class yesterday I thought, hasn't had a bad performance in a while but yesterday was beating men at will. Great to see.

Well that's wrong, because he did create a chance for mata on the volley and played a few decent balls in, but he was the only one who took players on and really made some progress going forward instead of keeping it safe and not trying anything. Getting back to his old reliable form, hopefully.

1554~~~
He was better than usual, but he still wasn't good.

The post injury Valencia is genuinely one of the most horrific footballers I've seen play for us and we've been subjected to it for 3 years.

1555~~~
He's been better than Rafael this season.

1556~~~
My point exactly. He was doing things that we would expect from any winger, and even then nowhere as good as any other wibger playing for the top teams. At least with Nani, barring his decision making, you knew that he was going to try and take on the defence with pace and make something happen.

1557~~~
It's easy to blame things on the formation we're using, but how about we acquire some wingers who can actually do things when they have the ball?  He beat a few players yesterday but his end product is still abysmal and led to nothing.  There was that one point in the first half, I believe, where he had a clear lane to shoot just outside of the box - an open shot at goal - and made a bullet cross on the ground into a maze of players.  I couldn't believe my eyes.

1558~~~
Nani would be fecking useless as a wingback so the comparison is pointless.

1559~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He was the only attacking thrust in our team in the first half. Beat his man time and again and attacked spaces. 

Laughable people don't see how well he is doing his job.

1560~~~
He's been better than Rafael since November.

Rafael was very good before his first (technically second) injury this season.

1561~~~
Except that we shouldn't be playing this dumb 3-5-2.

1562~~~
Nothing to do with his injury, that was 2010/11 and he won PoTY the following year.

1563~~~
Would be decent if he could pick people out regularly which he doesn't, I remember him pulling it back to Rooney against the scousers but that's about it. It's all well and good taking your man on, but it's absolutely useless if you do nothing with it. He always seems stuck in two minds whether to leather it across or play it back, and hangs onto it for so long that he makes the wrong decision. He definitely wasn't our worst player but I don't think he played well at all.

1564~~~
Every time he plays well, there are a sad bunch of fans who remind us that he was in fact only average and that it shows how standards have dropped.

1565~~~
Maybe not but we are. Comparing Nani to Valencia playing at wing back is pointless.

1566~~~
I thought he looked very good on Sunday. I still don't think he's any kind of long-term answer, but that reminded me of the 2011-12 version of Valencia. I even think he used his left foot a couple of times.

1567~~~
I wasn't really. I was saying that people are overrating Valencia's performances in terms of offensive play. If we want to hurt the opposition on the flanks we need someone better. Formations aside

1568~~~
Not great, but a really good squad player, always committed, runs non stop, and physically a beast, if only he had the footballing intelligence along with that pace, another plus, is hes barely ever injured

1569~~~
Has done excellent since that ankle break against Rangers, it was a horrible injury.

Showed just what a machine he is when that break happened, he stayed calm and in control, looked like he was just saying "shit this hurts" like when you stub your toe or something, not completely break your ankle.

1570~~~
<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/> Throw-ins, those fecking throw-ins.

1571~~~
Making Clint fecking Hill look like Maldini

1572~~~
Works hard like a coal miner without a flashlight.

1573~~~
Very good game from him today.

1574~~~
Brilliant player up to the final 3rd then refuses to take his man on now a days even though he is one v one 20 yards from the byeline.

1575~~~
Maybe someone should explain it  to him that it is physically impossible to cross the ball through a player. Defensively he was perfect.

1576~~~
Nice composed assist which lead to the goal.

1577~~~
Out of all our players he has the ball the most. Which highlights why we create so little. We are desperate for world class wing backs. Alvez in his prime, or even Coleman would do us wonders.

1578~~~
Played very well today.

1579~~~
Played well today? Wtf are you lot watching? Do we get points for bashing balls into opponents ankles? 

The least technically gifted player on our team, and it is ridiculous that we still have to see him play after three years of mostly poor performances.

1580~~~
I thought he was solid/average. It's a shame that Rafael can't get any run of games because his level is clearly higher than Valencia's.

1581~~~
Valencia needs to watch how one paced Daley Blind manages to whip in crosses.  Valencia only has his bash against the fullback and the cutback to the top of the box in his arsenal and it is painful to watch.

1582~~~
Someone needs to tell him how to throw the ball too.

1583~~~
If it is, he needs to show it on a football pitch. Not in people's memories.

1584~~~
Played pretty well I thought. Solid defensively and unlike earlier in the season, he now holds the defensive line much much better

1585~~~
I thought he was good. Looking more confident and solid each week.

1586~~~
Thought he had a very good game as well, another assist, 5 for the season playing wing back or fullback really. People criticizing him just dislike him really because of his last few years but this season he has been pretty consistent with his good performances. He's getting past players, is a lot better defensively and is arguably the most reliable player on the ball to keep hold of it and run with it. His crossing is poor for the most part, but that's a mix of him hitting the defenders or just nobody reading the cross.

1587~~~
Certainly not this season

1588~~~
I know, because he hasn't been able to play, as I referenced when I said he had injuries.

1589~~~
Rafael's been considerably worse than Valencia this season whenever he has played though. So long as that continues he will be a bit part player, at best.

1590~~~
I think when he got back from his first injury he put a decent block of form together that was better than anything Valencia has shown as a RB/RWB. He was unfairly criticised after the Leicester match. Since then though it's been a bit stop-start and Valencia has been better definitely.

1591~~~
I thought the Leicester criticism was fair tbh but yeah, maybe he was good in the very early part of the season. I honestly can't remember. Been fairly crap in all his more recent games though. Needs to get his act together, pronto, or he'll be gone in the summer.

1592~~~
We all love Rafael, it was awesome to see him bounce back after the 5-3 game - He was terrific against West Ham. However, since then he's shown he's no different from our center backs in terms of injuries (He's had 20 of them since 2011) and has been defensively very suspect when on the pitch. Full backs tend to be rotated much lesser than other players, and the fact that Rafael is neither reliable in terms of injuries nor his defensive duties (Certainly in the eyes of LVG, not in the eyes of a lot of fans either) does not bode for him very well. He did improve a lot in 2012-13, but well- since then, he's unfortunately just not been good enough/fit enough. I understand he lends more fluency to our game than Valencia, and I love his tenacity on the pitch- but he tends to make those mistakes.

Antonio Valencia, how much ever he gets slaughtered for his one dimensional crossing (rightly so) has been solid defensively. As mentioned by the poster above, as long as that continues Rafael would continue to remain bit part.

1593~~~
He was good in the QPR game (I think it was that one) but then again everyone was. He does need a strong finish to the season because if Valencia does keep improving then Rafael's spot comes under serious scrutiny.

1594~~~
The only bit of sense floating around here. One assist that one would normally expect from any winger worth his salt and he's very good? He's first impulse is to pass the ball back, can't beat a man, can't deliver a cross, and today we've seen him indecisive on a throw. He doesn't inspire fear on the wings. Zero.

1595~~~
He's an eyesore to watch. Absolute eyesore. He offers feck all going forward, easy cut back and all of a sudden it's a good game. He wastes so many good chances to get the ball into the box. It's beyond the joke really.

1596~~~
Whether it's physicality, ability or having Jones pushed right out over by him, he's not getting beaten anything like as much as last season. Done a good job from a defensive point of view.

1597~~~
I've just about reached breaking point with this guy. He's a sorry excuse for a footballer.

1598~~~
Our attack revolves around him. Can't believe it. Sign a RB now.

1599~~~
Can't believe Rafa sat there watching Valencia play as badly as he did. Awful. Less likely to pass someone than a stationary object.

1600~~~
Incredible how far he's fallen. Of course he was never a fantastic footballer, but he was never close to being this bad. Basically a speed-merchant without any actual abilities who lost his pace. A new right back (seeing as Rafael is never fit) must surely be a priority, because it's ruining a lot of our attacks.

1601~~~
Inept going forward.

1602~~~
Utterly pointless.

1603~~~
A good compilation of terrible controls, passes and general decisions could be made.

1604~~~
Why is he even on the pitch? Pathetic. Absolutely useless. All he ever does is pass it back to the person who passes him the ball. He doesn't try to run at defenders anymore. He is playing against Cambridge ffs. At least show some attacking intent. And when he does try and put in a cross in it doest even cross the first defender. Absolutely shocking he is still playing for us.

1605~~~
Utterly useless.

1606~~~
He seems to have no footballing intelligence to go with no courage. My mother always said that that is not the recipe for a Manchester United player.

1607~~~
Genuine question.

Is this guy even League 2 standard? Like Fletcher against Yeovil not only did he not stand out but he actually struggled against lower league opposition. I mean all the rest of our players (even Jones) showed the odd touch of class but he did nothing positive of note all game. If the purpose of football was to smash the ball off your nearest opponents ankles he would have several Balon D'Or's by now. Unfortunately for him it isn't. Incredibly bad.

1608~~~
His lack of guts to take a man on, lack of intelligence or ability in the final third is reaching new levels now. I think VG loves his though as he never takes any risk whatsoever.

1609~~~
Remember that time a week ago when people were praising him for being our best attacking outlets for a run of several games? Oh thats right, you've all forgotten.

1610~~~
Had one of those "first touch of a rapist" games today, thankfully for him there were others on the pitch that were worse.

1611~~~
Bad game today.

1612~~~
So weird that Fergie, Moyes and LVG all play Valencia regularly but nobody else seems to rate him :/

1613~~~
I really dislike this player

1614~~~
Anybody got a gif of that run with the ball where he got confused? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1615~~~
The one thing I don't get is why we seem so utterly determined (and have done for years) to play our football through our worst outfield player as much as possible. Is it just because the opposition always leave him open and we can't be fecked to try and do anything more complicated like move off the ball and create space?

1616~~~
Has not been United standard for some time now. Occasionally has a good game but generally very inconsistent and lacks self belief and confidence. Don't think he can ever regain the great form when he first joined us.

1617~~~
that's pretty clever from our opponents, if you think about it. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1618~~~
Yeah he had a few good matches there. What really helped there was he could beat a man and try put a ball in but today they'd have a couple of defenders out on the wing so he'd have to try be smarter and do a bit of dribbling which doesn't really suit. Some of his touches today were just awful but then everyone can have a bad day. Some of them tbf to him did bobble a lot off the ground.

1619~~~
This is why I don't understand the criticism of Valencia. It's obvious LVG has instructed the players not to give the ball away and what does Valencia exceed at? Giving the ball away. So when Rooney/Carrick/Blind/Fellaini and every other player we have feels the need to look up and pretend their looking for a pass but then spray it wide to Valencia I can totally see why he passes back.

1620~~~
I certainly wasn't.

1621~~~

1622~~~
I didn't get the praise for him then either. Barring a couple of moments in a couple of matches, he has been gash going forward.

1623~~~
He was poor, but he's also utterly abandoned out there on the right. 

For 2 decades when we had the ball on the flanks you had both a full back and a winger close together, working to spread the defenders and create space. 

Tony V now has Fellaini meandering around, generally standing about 10 feet in from the half way line. Who can't run beyond Valencia, can't play one touch and move and can't pick a pass forwards. 

Valencia is essentially always double-teamed in this system. It's actually worse in a 352.

1624~~~
Part of the deadwood that needs to be rid of if we're going to progress as a team.

1625~~~
No he wasn't double teamed.

Especially when Herrera came on. He had chances to take on his defender, but he passed back.

1626~~~
What is it about Valencia that a succession of managers seem to love?

I'm truly fed up with him either slowing the attack down with a halt and backwards pass, or hitting the ball straight at the opposition defender.

Call me old fashioned but when he gets the ball he should use his pace to get to the line and put in one of a variety of different crosses to keep the opponent guessing.

1627~~~
There's really is no one else to play there(Rafael is always injured and Saidy Janko from the U21 is hardly pulling up trees).

1628~~~
tony standstill strikes again. made the cambridge united lb look good.

1629~~~
Is it just me, or does he not look that particularly quick anymore? He used to be my favourite player. The first and third seasons with us (with his second being blighted by that nasty injury) were explosive. He just got ball, ran past anyone infront of him and got the ball in behind. A loose ball on the counter would usually see Valencia win it even if his opponent had a head start. He was lightning. Does he still have that in him?

His pace was/is his strongest asset and is what made him so effective. Even if the end product wasn't there, he was skinning everyone for pace. I can't remember the last time I saw him leave an opponent for dust like he used to do. Everytime he knocks the ball on, he rarely ever beats his man to it.

Nowdays, he's just a solid defender who often doesn't lose out in a one on one or a physical encounter, but his threat looks completely non-existent. In the old days, you'd have opponents doubling up on him, and he'd still get beyond them. Now he's given a lot of space, but he still looks so untreatening. If he's going to play in a system without any forward width like the diamond or the 352, then he needs to be an outlet, but he plays such a conservative game. I don't know if that is by instruction, but in Fergie's final season, last season under Moyes and this year, he's not come anywhere near what we know he is capable of, if he still is capable.

1630~~~
I agree, if he had Januzaj or dimaria or any other winger in front of him he could still be a valuable player, no player apart maybe young can play wingback properly in our team so I don't understand why we stick to that, or well full back in diamond where there is no natural winger in front of him. Fellaini is so awful at the line.

He was bad today but he is a great professional but I still think he could be a valuable back up, we don't need to spend money here, COleman or Clyne would also struggle today except Valencia's touch today was really horrid let alone his crosses.. but no support is no support, too many players don't know how to play in their positions..

1631~~~
It's very difficult for him to contribute <i>absolutely </i>nothing all season going forward given he plays every game. He had that good run in the Liverpool game and the assist against QPR, but he's generally awful in an attacking sense. His attempted crosses gets blocked, when he does manage to put the ball in the box it's shit, can't beat his man and can't show any good link up play.

1632~~~
He's awful, we'd be better off getting Zaha back and using him as an actual right winger than having Valencia as a wingback.

1633~~~
woefully awful.  No idea what happened to him but he is only a shadow of his former potential...not a clue.

1634~~~
For the last two years he has been awful. If we had a functioning winger on the right it would stretch out the play, create space and make a world of difference to our game. Our forwards have little to no service. We are essentially playing a 532 except our wingers (and wing backs) are not performing as they should...not even close.

1635~~~
I honestly don't understand why he still plays for us. We are useless at moving on useless players.

1636~~~
I don't want to go back to Moyes tactics of getting to the byline and blasting it in but doing it occasionally wouldn't hurt, would it? Getting the ball deep into their half a few times and putting it low and hard across into the mixer would have caused all sorts of problems and given Falcao a bit of blood to sniff out.

Just attack them man, at the very worst it'll bounce back off your leg for a throw in or goal kick.

1637~~~
Struggling to understand what Tony doing in this team. He's been consistently shite under 3 fecking managers and he's still here <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>.

1638~~~
So, he can't cut in, he doesn't take his man on, and if he ever does.. He can't cross.

This renders him pointless.

But one thing I can't get my head around, how did he lose the ability to cross the ball? I'm convinced that he was a pretty good crosser when he first arrived here. I remember him standing it up in the air a lot, the exact opposite to what he does now. Another thing that annoys me is when he does take his man on, he usually beats him!

1639~~~
Still can't believe this is the guy who was ripping Ashley Cole to shreds and now is scared to take on his man.

1640~~~
He is not a FB. He definitely does not look like a winger anymore. So what's his use in this team? He is an average footballer now who is being played out of position because he is awful in his usual position and contributes little to nothing to our attacks.

1641~~~
This 100%. I can't think of any other player that was as reliant on pace as Valencia. Even at his peak in 2011-2012 in terms of technical ability he was very average. All he did was knock the ball past the full back and whip a cross in. So simple and so effective. He didn't have the ability to beat a player with a bit of skill so it was all about the pace. It was obvious that once he lost that he would be finished at the top level. Now he doesn't have the pace to get past the full back to make the space for the cross, hence why the vast majority of his crosses hit the opposing full back on the shins.

1642~~~
I think this guy deserves some praise. He nullifies fast attackers to such an extent that people just take it for granted. Almost single handedly, he ruined Newcastle's counter attacking play by outpacing them time and time again. He did the same against Southampton with that fast lad down the wing, and Schlupp was given nothing today. Almost any other fullback in the league would have struggled at least from time to time against these players.

I also don't think he's a defensive liability so much anymore. He saved Rooney's arse and then another one later on.

1643~~~
They got no joy down our right until he came off, I'd say he'll be the starting RB until the end of the season.

1644~~~
Some praise for the man, I'm suprised. I had come in here to plead his case. I had "judge him as a fullback" ready to go.

1645~~~
Solid performance but really leceister posed no threat at all from that left flank of theirs.

1646~~~
We also posed no threat down the right, again.

1647~~~
He is poor in attacking areas though. He put in my one decent high cross today, which sadly for him, is better than usual.

1648~~~
This - he's still looking short of confidence up front, though he did take on his man a few times and actually got a few good crosses in (one first half early that RvP almost reached was surprisingly whipped in) and liked up nicely at times.. Still he can do better in attack and lost the ball on a few dribbles when he shouldn't have. 

Defensively he's been VERY sound  surprising considering how he looked in Fergie's last 2 years any time h had to play at RB.

1649~~~
True, but Schlupp also worked his arse off to double up on Valencia every time he got close to an attacking area. He has to carry the entire attack down that side. On the other flank, Shaw and Januzaj had a much better working relationship as Januzaj played more as an out and out winger.

1650~~~
His defending and positioning has improved quite considerably. Well done to him for that. Going forward, however, he's worse than ever. He gets so much time and space and produces so, so little.

1651~~~
Sums it up really. He's done a respectable job converting to right back in many ways but he's just so limited on the ball. He's terrible at passing it infield, partly due to his inability to use his left foot. Ivanovic's pass to Hazard for Chelsea's equaliser showed the value of having a full back who is capable of some level of variety in his passing game. That said, he's done a good enough job defensively to keep him around.

1652~~~
Not a biggest fan but I'm okay with him as long as he doesn't play as a winger. There will be games when his power and speed will not be enough but I have to admit he is improving his positioning.

1653~~~
It looks like he has worked hard on his defensive positioning and it is really starting to show. I imagine in the summer we'll be buying a RB who can defend and offer a lot more in attack, but Valencia has no doubt cemented the squad spot ahead of Rafael.

1654~~~
This - I was trying to recall who was supposed to be in tandem with AV when he was playing RB and couldn't remember... RvP?? Our right side has suffered for Rafael's fall from grace in the starting line-up. Him and AV were a very strong combination 2-3 years ago.

1655~~~
The annoying thing he's an assured passer and has got it in his locker. Watch his outside of the boot, infield pass into the path of a turning RvP who should have done better today. Might be the moment when RvP played in Falcao in the first half and the latter almost managed to work space for a shot.

1656~~~
It may not seem like he's doing much, but taking him off and watching the opposition suddenly get runs down our right side tells a lot.

Having said that, his offensive delivery is still poor and really holding us back.

1657~~~
I thnk he is a better right back then Rafael


I will run away now

1658~~~
We dominate that much of the ball he's not been tested that much defensively. Would prefer Rafael offensively but Valencia wasn't bad last game. Needs to keep being positive.

1659~~~
me too

1660~~~
OMG randall stop saying things I agree with, this is getting silly now.

1661~~~
You and Randall disgust me.

1662~~~
Are you still upset about Cuadrado?

1663~~~
Let's bee friends

1664~~~
I am, but you disgust me.

1665~~~
He does the job whenever he plays, but we need somebody better in the summer.

1666~~~
I wish we had a healthy RB so we could use Valencia as the right sided CM in the diamond instead of Fellaini.

1667~~~
I wish we had a better right back and centrebacks so we could play Herrera and Di Maria ahead of Blind or Carrick and never use Valencia ever again.

1668~~~
Barely. And that's not the standard United needs.

1669~~~

1670~~~
Who were the other candidates?

1671~~~
Blind and Rojo

I would have given it to Rojo to be honest.

1672~~~
Yeah, same. Bit strange.

1673~~~
It's a surprise, but he's been decent.

I'd have voted for Blind.

1674~~~
I don't have the same aversion to Valencia as some on here, but Rojo was brilliant and deserved it more imo.

1675~~~
He's done ok defensively but he still offers next to nothing going forward, which for a winger/wing back whatever you want to call him isn't good enough.

1676~~~
He's not been terrible but he hardly warrants player of the month. Who votes for this stuff? Surprised he even made the top 3, let alone win the thing.

1677~~~
Good on him.

1678~~~
I quite like him - two things ppl might be ignoring

1. i don't think either Blind or Rojo have actually played all january games so that may hae swung it
2. if they did i'd agree AV shouldnt have won..

1679~~~
Well done to him. Think Rojo was a little better though.

1680~~~
Kinda sums up how poorly we have been playing, I mean Valencia has been decent but nothing much more than that as he doesn't add anything to the attack.

1681~~~
well done Antonio - hopefully he puts in a good performance tomorrow

think Rojo has been pretty flawless in the last 3 games though

1682~~~
United Facebook fans are funny. Blind and Rojo wasn't particular outshone everyone but they've been very solid. Tony can defend well but his final ball is just shite. 
Also Rojo got the lowest vote?? This is nonsense

1683~~~
He's done a good job defensively and been very reliable at RB. The issue is his lack of contribution going forward. It becomes a problem because it seems so much of our attack gets directed wide right and he's not doing anything positive.

1684~~~
Player of the month? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1685~~~
This guy.... he's become a parody of himself

1686~~~
His crossing is feckin woeful. Bring on Mcnair

1687~~~
Defensively okay.

1688~~~
In attack shocking. In defense very good. 

Played as a fullback, that's an acceptable performance.

1689~~~
It's his brainfart and the touch of a pub player is what cost us that goal. If LVG has no faith in Rafael then he better buy a top quality RB in the summer. Valencia does not deserve to be United's first choice RB. He is fkng awful offensively.

1690~~~
This guy...he's suddenly become a good rb that's shit going forward despite him actually being a winger...

1691~~~
Thought he was good today. I only watched the second half though.

1692~~~
Turn back Tony has become mop up Tony, covered for our CB's a number of times today and was overall solid.

1693~~~
Was defensively quite solid till he had the brain fart. Still unbelievable how crap his crossing is.

1694~~~
He was bloody immense today. Ran the whole right flank on his own. The diamond is such a shit formation when it comes to protecting the backline.

He had to basically man the entire right side of the pitch himself and he came through with flying colors.

1695~~~
He did alright for most of the time but his lack of a decent first touch got West Ham the freekick which resulted in the goal. Also the moment he got the ball on the right wing, he controled the ball, waited, waited, waited, looked to the middle, crossed and hit the first incoming playing was bad. It was so bad i had to laugh actually

1696~~~
I don't think he's been bad defensively this season and at least he's not injured half the time like most of our defenders. Offensively still offers next to nothing but then again, our midfielders (Rooney in particular) are guilty of too often taking the easy option knowing he'll be there.

1697~~~
That moment when he had time and space to cross it first time but decided to control it, just to hammer it on their defenders was funny. It's like a robot was programmed to do it.

1698~~~
Can we get Beckham or Neville back, so they can have a one to one session with him on how to cross the ball.

1699~~~
Thought he did well, but maybe my expectations when it comes to him are very low.

1700~~~
It all goes to shit when he attempts the final ball, but apart from that he's been one of our most reliable players this season. Always makes himself available and covers loads of ground on and off the ball. And most of this has been from RB without a proper winger in front of him.

1701~~~
Nowhere near being our biggest problem. I wish he was.

1702~~~
That’s exactly what he is. He’s the kind of first-generation Russian robot that can only run in straight lines but is very reliable and never breaks. You can’t update him because they don’t produce them anymore- this version turned out to be too limited for the market.

Good defensively but I find his attacking play amazingly poor. Short term solution but I would love McNair to take that rightback spot from him as soon as possible (if he can cross then he’s already close).

1703~~~
He's defended very well. I cannot remember anyone getting the better of him, but it's so annoying he's our only attacking width on the right. The guy is absolute shit in the attacking third.

1704~~~
He was a <i>fantastic </i>defender today imo. Just watch specially the first half again - wonderful and important tackle after wonderful and important tackle.

1705~~~
seems like another Player of the Month award coming up for Antonio.

1706~~~
Showed again he's a good professional and useful squad player until his legs go, though if we sign another RB, it should probably be at some other big club that needs RW, RM, RCM, RW and RB cover.

1707~~~
He deserves lots of credit for the improvement of his defensive game. The difference from last season to this is exceptional in this regard.

1708~~~
Absolutely, he got caught out time and time again when Moyes put him back there last season.

1709~~~
It's really absurd. He looks like a defensive fullback, in the mould of Shaw, Azpi etc... Who defend well but leave a lot to be desired offensively, and nothing like a winger playing RB.

1710~~~
Is an absolute machine , one of those players every team needs, I know hes poor going forward, but hestill always gets forward, and doesnt shy away from receiving the ball, always running up and down, no nonsense player

1711~~~
RB seems to be his new long term position which I'm happy with, he's been fantastic defensively.

His attacking is annoyingly crap though, could do with a quality player on the right in front of him.

1712~~~
I think the days of him playing as a winger are gone now, even if we went back to a formation that adopts them. If he can turn himself into a Right Back capable of starting games and performing consistently (as he has for the most part recently), then fair play to him. Van Gaal certainly seems to prefer him to Rafael.

1713~~~
Not a bad defensive performance, though disappointed that his mistake indirectly led to their goal.

Shit on a stick offensive performance, though. But if he becomes a RB then I won't count that as much against him.

1714~~~
Defensively he was pretty solid today, made a few sliding tackles that were really well judged and timed. 

Going forward he's useless but as an actual defender he's no weak link. I'd still want a new first choice right back bought in the Summer though.

1715~~~
Thought it was one of his better defensive displays, still a shadow of Rafael though. Credit to him though, he has been performing well in a hopelessly balanced side.

1716~~~
He's done a bit of a 180 the past couple of years. Defensively great these days and shite going forward. Ironic really for someone so fond of doing a 360 when facing his fullback.

1717~~~
Would rather McNair got the game time at right back.

1718~~~
His transformation into a defender is pretty much complete.

And to think, this guy was our main offensive outlet in a title winning season just a few years ago <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1719~~~
Not even that, he was arguably one of the best wingers in Europe alongside Nani. How times change.

1720~~~
It really is quite incredible.

1721~~~
He's so poor going forward it's unreal. It badly affects our buildup play since we go through him so often. He's just so slow and indecisive, any momentum we had in the attack dies when the ball is at his feet. For me, Rafael must play when available.

1722~~~
Solid defensively. But going forward dreadful. Don't mind him being our back-up RB but would prefer Rafael is given another run. He is our best RB. I know McNair is the current flavour of the month but let's be honest, it was against Cambridge.

1723~~~
5 assists? I can only remember the one for Rooney against Liverpool, which was nicely done to be fair. He actually did really well in the build up for that goal too which makes it even more frustrating when you see him smashing every single cross low and hard into players shins. It feels like there's still a player in there somewhere.

1724~~~
One of the culprits who makes our play predictable. Like you said momentum just shifts to 0 and that allows opposition to get back into position. Its know wonder why most of hiss crosses are blocked. We need to players in the team who like to be on the ball, who have the confidence to get forward and exploit space in behind, he simply does not do it for me.

1725~~~
We need to rewire our heads. Valencia is not a winger anymore, he's a defensively reliable RB, our first choice RB who is good enough only on our side of the pitch.

1726~~~
He frustrates me as a winger but he seems more and more a proper right back. His positioning improved and he uses his body well. 

He did cost us a few points due to being overrun at times last season but I don't have a bad feeling with him as right back recently. Hope he can prove me right in the coming big games.

1727~~~
Valencia couldn't cross a stationary object, Gary Neville must be horrified that his old slot is being filled by someone who cant overlap or cross. How the hell does Valencia offer more than Rafa at right back?

1728~~~
When he played RW with Rafael behind him the two had a good understanding. It's just a shame his final ball has deteriorated so much.

1729~~~
Awful. I'm sorry but this man has not been good enough to start for MUFC for at least 2 years.

At least 5 or 6 times he found himself in behind in fantastic crossing positions with time and space and delivered fecking nothing.

I'd be happy to see him move on in the summer. He runs alot and gets up and down the line. Otherwise not nearly a starting MUFC player.

1730~~~
He's fecking shite. I'm sorry...but he is.

1731~~~
His crosses are usually frustating but him, Blind and De Gea have been our backbones this year. Name another United player who has beat his man as often as Valencia has.
<a class="username" data-user="87566, @red_7" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87566/">@red_7</a> I think it was the total opposite. He was one of the few with pace and power last season, he saved us a lot of points.

1732~~~
Could not disagree with you more. Very poor.

1733~~~
Paddy McNair in one game demonstrated how vital a full back who has abit of intelligence can be to a side's style and effectiveness going forward.

He had Rooney on the right wing in front of him and yet it worked beautifully. Valencia ruins so many attacks it is untrue. Defensively I can't fault him but he is not good enough going forwards for a club of this calibre.. his crossing is a car crash, utterly horrendous.

1734~~~
So his crosses don't frustate you at all? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1735~~~
Did well today I thought for the most part. A couple of assists (won't be credited for the second one though I think). He's gotten a lot better going forward this season then the last few.
Edit: Actually apparently that was Young who gave it to herrera. Never mind. Still decent.

1736~~~
He was average for the most part, diabolical at times and decent in flashes.

So average overall.

If that hospital he played in the second half had resulted in a goal, he would probably of had to walk home.

1737~~~
You can never question his commitment and work levels, he did ok I thought bar a couple of defensive lapses, but I don't think our two nervy CB's helped him or Shaw at times, nothing excuse that dreadful backpass though, that was all his! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1738~~~
I dont see what he does that Rafael doesnt do.

1739~~~
He doesn't get injured, that's about it. He's a solid enough option 'til we can bring in a new right-back in the summer.

1740~~~
Can we then sell him? Pretty please?

1741~~~
Valencia is useless shock horror

1742~~~
Some harsh comments, thought he was excellent today.  Preston were clogging up the middle so we had to go to the flanks and Valencia had a huge part in both goals, the flick that found Young in space to assist to Herrera and then the classic Tony V push the ball past the defender and cross which found Fellaini.

Defensively was solid except for a couple lapses, but other than that shut down their left side as usual. The goal was caused by Herrera losing his man, as Tony was cutting out the danger inside.

Not sure what is expected these days as I think Tony is the least of our issues.  Plenty of other area to focus on, unless we're bringing in a world class right back (can't think of too many realistic ones) I feel Tony with Rafael as backup are have us covered there.

1743~~~
It was an improvement, but i cannot comprehend why he jogs upto defenders and stops 1v1. I know he did run at them a couple of times, but this is supposed to be natural winger, he should be running directly at the full back every single time he gets the chance. He's got pace and he's strong, if he was more positive going forward he'll skin his man even though he's the most predictable player in the league.

1744~~~
He was a great winger up until the point Scholes retired.

Valencia needs support from a midfield that will spread the play quickly so that he has a chance to get a run at his defender. He's finding it slightly easier at right back, but our passing is still too slow to get the best out of him. He'll never beat his marker with a trick so the pass into him needs to do that for him. If we can get Valencia level with the defender, he's still an extremely dangerous player.

1745~~~
I'm a dangerous player when I'm free. I understand he lacks support, the passing is slow and there's no one overlapping to create overloads. However, there are times when he is 1v1 with a clear run at the defender, and he decides against driving at him and making something happen. That has nothing to do with our style of play because I'm talking about a distinct type of situation, and he should be trying to beat his man every single time.

1746~~~
I bet you don't have Valencia's pace and strength to hold off defenders.

He proved he could be one of the best wingers in the world when you play him the right way. He was never any good at beating players 1-on-1 even at his best. His style was always more physical than that, but it's being mitigated by the way we've set up in the last few years.

1747~~~
Neither does he at this stage to be fair.

1748~~~
I don't think he's lost much pace. He's simply unable to try a knock-and-run because his side of the pitch is so congested by the time the pass comes in.

1749~~~
No, I don't, which is why it's frustrating to not use it to it's full potential. You start driving at a full back 1v1 with the pace and power he has and get them back-pedalling, he doesn't need to have a repertoire of tricks to gain a yard for a cross or pass. I've seen him do it before, I'm not asking for anything out of the ordinary, he did it once tonight and it lead to a goal ffs.

You mention our play is slow and predictable and you're correct. Having him jog up to defenders, stop stationary and then pass the ball backwards is as much a contributor to that as it is a consequence of it.

1750~~~
Anyone else feel he's really physically declined lately?

1751~~~
Dante I always support Valencia but he gets one on one with defenders to many times and declines to take them on! Passing the ball sideways or backwards from 20-30 yards of the byeline. This is something you'd never see a Hazard Bale or even Sterling do I'd love if someone could pull stats on this. How many times he ops not to take a man on in the last 25 yards. It's horrible and really affects our play.

1752~~~
You can't be serious here? How many times in the last 2 seasons has Rooney found him on the right with all the space in the world to run at his full back only for him to turn back and pass it to Rafael?

I thought he did well against Preston. By the standards he's set in the last 2 years it was almost a world class performance.

1753~~~
Valencia imo was quite decent yesterday compared some of his previous games. Stats confirm the same as well. He attempted 61 passes yesterday, 2nd behind Blind, with 88.5% accuracy, again 2nd behind Fellaini with 89%. 4 long balls attempted, 4 accurate. 4 crosses, 2 accurate. 3 key passes, 3 interceptions, 3 clearances. Which shows he was well involved both offensively as well as in defense. He played a part in conceding the goal but will be harsh to blame him too much for that. Overall quite good performance. His physicality is added advantage over Rafael in defensive situations and he is lesser prone than Rafael to do rash things. I personally would love Rafael to be given more chances as he can be more creative going forward and link with forwards better but not too worried over Valencia at the moment. If McNair develops into a good RB, then we have a alternative waiting as well.

1754~~~
I would like to see Rafa get a few games under his belt, albeit stay healthy more than one game at a time, and show his quality.  I still think rafa has something about him that sets him apart from placing Valencia ahead of him.  Maybe its the fact he can use his left foot but still....so many times Valencia will beat his man and can cut back with his left and doesn't do anything with minus go back to his right.  He reminds me of a Sunday league guy who you know can only use one foot(we all know exactly what Valencia is going to do and so does the left back) and still does it. He is mediocre at crossing and his short passing leaves a lot to be desired. At Least Rafa can link up something Valencia struggles at

1755~~~
This. He also had our 2nd most successful dribbles (3) after ADM. He had a good (not great) game as the only player down the right who had to both attack <span style="text-decoration: underline">and</span> defend constantly -  his stats show this and his namecheck by LvG shows he is appreciated by his teammate and management if not the eFans online:

1756~~~
Just no. He was awful in Fergie's last season when Scholes was still playing.

1757~~~
Eh? If there is one thing you can't accuse AV of is being unabe to pass short - he had our 2nd msot passes and 2nd highest passing accuracy! And 2nd highest long ball accuracy. Most of the linking up Rafael has done for us over his  greatstint at RB has been with AV making the proper-weighted passesin their interplay...when Rafael had to play as a RWB this year running the flanks alone he struggled w/o that link up.

Some people seem to just want to narrate their own story of events rather than facts. The only thing AV needs to improve on (outside of using his lefty of course) is his crossing but yesterday it was improved - he made 4 crosses, our 3rd most attempts behind ADM (8) and Rooney (5)) and 2 were accurate (our most - ADM had zero and Rooney only 1) and one lead to the winner. And he's doing that playing as a defender not a winger or attacker as the other two so can't just run forward exposing our backline willy nilly. 

His role in the team has obviously changed this year but people still expect him to play like a winger <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1758~~~
Not so sure, think the stats flatter him here if you only look at the big numbers. 2 of his 3 dribbles were in his own half and of his 76 passes only 9 were closer to the goal than the halfway line. All too often he'd try and start to go past a player, only to turn back and pass it safely into centre mid. Good for your stats, but not a good performance.

I think the lack of penetration from both him and Shaw were a major problem yesterday. With no attacking threat from the full backs we were far too narrow. Thought he was better than Shaw though.

1759~~~
I think Tony gets a bit of a raw deal at times. He is pretty reliable at RB, perhaps more so than Rafael, especially if you factor in their relative availability. He is quick, strong, good one on one, decent in the air and can pass well enough. He has his limitations too obviously but I think they are much less of an issue when playing as a RB.

1760~~~
I'm a big fan of Valencia and thinks he gets a lot of unfair shit on here but I thought he had a poor game last night. His worst in a while. Even though he did get a good assist (that was an assist, right?) Some wayward passing, poor decisions and didn't defend their goal as well as he could have. If Van Gaal is picking on merit he has to be at risk of being dropped for our next game.

1761~~~
He's a solid option, and an absolute athlete. I like Valencia.

1762~~~
Scholes hardly played that season though.

1763~~~
I quite like that we can compare and contrast our player rating to the average rating. So I know which players I may be overrating, or RedCafe may be underrating.

1764~~~
I underrate every player apparently, which is weird coz I dont see myself as a moaner.

1765~~~
I seem to just underrate a lot of our players.

1766~~~
Did ok when he came on, nothing game changing but made the right side more secure.

1767~~~
There was a moment in the 2nd half when a corner came out to him outside the area. Instead of playing a simple pass to the left, he turned 180 degrees and ran horizontally across the pitch before running down the right flank again. All to avoid passing with this left!

1768~~~
Incredible commitment really. Berbatov used to do the same, or try and hook it with the outside of his foot.

Completely one footed players annoy me. We seem to have a lot of them.

1769~~~
Berbatov looked exquisite and nonchalant though<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Valencia looks crap.

I do wonder though why he hasn't improved upon it. You look at Herrera in the team, so completely at ease with either foot and surely you've gotta feel a bit embarrassed at how bad you are?!? I know I would if it was me.

1770~~~
Should have started today.

1771~~~
If we're going to play a diamond, than Valencia is much suited to right back than McNair.

1772~~~
When your 9 to 5 is training, practicing and improving as a footballer, there really should be no excuse for not working on your weak foot. I find it astounding how players can play at this level with a useless weak foot. You'd think coaches would notice it and have one footed players working on it.

I still rate him as a solid RB though. He would have been much better than McNair was, who was just all over the place.

1773~~~
If Rafael is being frozen out then Valencia has to be our RB. McNair is nowhere near ready to be a starting RB for a PL team. Thought he was solid enough anyway, was basically the usual. Had to laugh at the commentator who said something about always getting great delivery from him out wide.

1774~~~
His delivery wasn't half bad today though, but on a general note, that is quite amusing. Did you see him knocking it hard and low with his left, ancle destroyer style? He is two footed after all.

1775~~~
Another solid outing from TBT this week, unless we can get Danilo I don't care about upgrading the RB role this summer.

1776~~~
His improvements defensively are actually quite phenomenal. He's become a good player to have around again as opposed to the liability he was.

1777~~~
Glad you bumped this thread. Valencia is Mr consistent, who always gives 110%.

1778~~~
Honestly I much prefer him over Rafael right now. Though Rafael doesn't deserve to be completely left out like he is right now.

1779~~~
I really like him at rightback. Especially when he has a winger ahead of him. 

When he played as a winger before he played the conservative supporting role the fullback should play and it was fraustrating. Now he has learnt the fullback position properly he's becoming a real credit to the side. He won't be beaten for speed or strength and he's rarely rash or over commits. 


The only trouble he has is that he's so fecking hench he finds it physically impossible to do a legal throw in.

1780~~~
His attacking could still be a lot better but he got in a nice cutback that Rooney should have done more with. Defensively sound again- with Valencia these days, it's almost like the less you notice him the better he's played.

1781~~~
Valencia really facilitated Januzaj on that flank today. Like Young, Valencia also looks faster these days - his sprints to overlap Januzaj were great to see. Also, he had a terrific cross for Young that nearly resulted in a goal and his flicks in and around the box are quite something at times. 

I think he's starting to get unnoticed. He more or less kills off counter attacks by simply outpacing and outmuscling the opposition attackers. Very solid displays defensively as of late, and he can even head the ball. As you said, he doesn't have to bulk UP though.

1782~~~
He's a better defender then he is an attacker nowadays.

Its bloody mental <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1783~~~
If only he could be a bit better in the final third with accurate crosses he's brilliant, never the player to worry about because he's always solid.

1784~~~
He is doing a very good job at right back - credit to him. Only one moment from him annoyed me when he failed to release a cut back, but apart from that he was great.

1785~~~
He used to smash in low driven crosses.  Now he floats in curlers.

1786~~~
His motor is amazing. Continues to sprint up and down the pitch in the 80th minute like he did in the first 20.

1787~~~
He's on a really good run of form and one of the few players that have shown any consistency in the last few months, he's really made an effort to become a proper RB in my view.

1788~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> His throw ins are just bizarre. Surely someone in the coaching staff must have had a word by now. How hard can it be?

Is really mastering the RB position though. Probably one of the best in the league this season.

1789~~~
He has improved dramatically as a rb, we should be looking for a new one still but he will be very good competition for the new arrival.

1790~~~
Somehow LVG has turned him from a "modern" fullback (failed winger) into a classic defensive fullback. Tony just forgot to failed as a winger much later than most converted players.  I think it is clear that he has benefited from LVG's extreme attention to detail as far as what he is expected to do when defending, because he never looked this competent defensively when played at RB in the past.

He looks far better when he has a wide player to overlap.  He just doesn't have a cross from deep like a natural fullback should have developed by now.

But this whole metamorphosis is just bizarre with its speed and how natural he looks at the position.  He plays like I imagine Luke Shaw would if he never progresses as an attacker.

1791~~~
If he keeps it up we might not need a new RB at all. I'm just hoping he gets his offensive game to improve just a notch and he will perfect for us.

1792~~~
He's a bit underrated as a fullback, because he's not running around flying into tackles or doing anything noticeably brilliant, but he's looking very reliable and solid and not much is getting past him as he's so strong and quick. A dependable consistent unspectacular player that stays fit which makes him a far better bet than Rafael at the minute for us.

1793~~~
He's very solid and it was another solid performance. Would probably still rather him be a back-up though.

1794~~~
Has improved his defending quite a bit. I've always been vocal about his errors leading to goals when playing right back, but he's been switched on this season. Credit where it's due.

1795~~~
Amazing that people still think that Rafael should play over him when he's in this form. Rafael being left out of the team in this matter is uncalled for, Rafa should get more games, but, Valencia is in the form of his life. Rarely is he beaten defensively, and not too bad overlapping and providing width. Been immense for me and i wanted him as far away from OT as possible over the summer <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> . Life is funny i tell you.

1796~~~
He had one decent game against a fairly poor opponent so far. We need a new right back starter and Valencia isn't the kind of caliber we need to get back to the top. He might have improved defensively but going forward he still offers nothing which is pretty much what he has been doing for almost 3 seasons now.

1797~~~
I reckon he's the sort of player who opposition wingers are starting to dread playing against. As I said above, you can't beat him for pace or strength, his positioning is getting very good now and, especially with a winger ahead of him, he can really keep the opposition winger and fullback on the backfoot in their own half.

1798~~~
He's definitely improved defensively, which is great. He really needs to to work on his crossing still. I fear it is like banging your head against a brick wall though, or In Valencia's case, a football.

1799~~~
I've given him lots of stick as I've thought he wasn't good enough for us for a while now but to be fair to him he's putting in decent performances and he is finally starting to vary his crosses which is important as so many of our attacks go through him.

1800~~~
I liked him going forward yesterday. Good link up play and drove the ball forward pretty well.

1801~~~
Him and Januzaj looked good together - much better than when ADM was there because ADM unerringly went inside meaning there was never any overlapping and overloading (or he didn't use it). Made a great cross that Young almsot scored from, and almost set up Wazza fter a great run into the box. I always preferred him as a winger as he used to ball watch but I think Louis' coaching team have fixed that and he's quite solid now. Better than Evra was the last 2 years with us as he also gets back constantly.

1802~~~
Very decent performance yesterday, and his cross for Smashley hitting the bar was lovely. I'm very much a Rafael fan, but Tony deserves to play if he shows this form.

1803~~~
Yep I agree but he looks concussed at times. I wish he'd stop refusing to take men on in 1 v 1 situations in the final 3rd. It makes me weep! Plus hopefully he'll start overlapping at pace and more frequently.

1804~~~
Agreed, but in the last few games he has looked his old self. I wonder if might be coming good just at the right time.

1805~~~
I think he has had more than one decent game tbh and he looks like he has got to grips with the requirements of the position. I think his attacking output will get better as he regains confidence with more good/very good games and btw with a proper winger ahead of him we don't need a high standard of attacking play from him. Be that as may I think he will benefit from the winger grabbing more attention from him giving him more space and time.
Going into next season I will be comfortable with him as our first choice right back, especially this version of him who is more clued up defensively. We still need a few more players and their acquisitions will cost large sums of money so why not utilize the players we have and use the twenty or so million quid it would take to sign Clyne or Coleman?

1806~~~
The man is far from being one of our biggest issues. The philosophy has actually helped him out a little. I'm sure Louis has no problem with Antonio taking the safe option of passing it inside instead of taking his man on, something we all know that he's incapable of doing  at a high level like the former player of the year used to.

1807~~~
Obviously Valencia is no longer the right winger and does not have a full back behind him if he is attacking down the right. I can see why he would be hesitant at times as he doesn't want to leave us exposed considering he is the right back. It is now about improving his decision making of when to take a risk going forward and to try and beat his man. He still has it in him (see assist against Liverpool), it is really a matter of balance. He has certainly improved defensively in the role, just need him to get back to some of that attacking play.

1808~~~
Seems to have got his crossing back - nobody coming on the end of those though.

1809~~~
Still hinders our play, like he has done for almost 3 years. Still, if people enjoy that fair enough.

1810~~~
I dont see what he brings that Rafael doesnt.

1811~~~
One of our better players tonight for me.

1812~~~
Consistency. Good defending. Good passing. What would you like?

1813~~~
Go back in this thread and you will see I am the opposite of a Valencia fanboy, but I fail to see how people are complaining about his recent performances, he was good tonight, gave them nothing down his side and linked well in attack, put a peach of a cross in that Moppy should have buried.

1814~~~
He's not doing anything wrong really. Except for spending about 30 seconds deciding what to do each time he gets the ball.

1815~~~
Panic.

1816~~~
Working legs.

I thought he was good tonight.

1817~~~
You forgot to add that he is one of the most wasteful players in the squad to that list.

1818~~~
Thought he was one of the best players tonight.

1819~~~
Strange that continual managers don't see it that way. He's performing better than Rafael. That's why he's playing.

1820~~~
He needed to get closer to his winger at times in the second half, could be that he is blitzed mind.

1821~~~
Our best out-field player tonight. Thought he was impressive.

1822~~~
Yes because without him we play the most fluid football in the world.

Sometimes it seems like people watch different games. He defended well - crossing was perfect today i felt. He rarely loses the ball and was overlapping creating space for the winger every time.

1823~~~
Good play with ADM which added a lot of pressure. Our right wing was by far better than our left wing

1824~~~
My preference is someone who takes more risks and LVG's anti risk tactics are stifling most of our play. Valencia has just been that player for ages though.

1825~~~
Keeps impressing and fair play to him. His crossing even looked better.

1826~~~
I don't even mind him not taking risks as such, I'd just like him to not spend as much time deciding to pass it back. Just keep it moving in one or two touches eventually a passing lane will open and you can play a one-two or whatever to get in behind.

1827~~~
To be fair to him, he's not the only one who does it but he does it more often than anyone else, and it always gives teams time to get everyone back.

1828~~~
Yep there's still a lack of movement in our team making it difficult to play quickly. I've always been brought up with the mantra that if you don't have an immediate passing option forwards then you use the next best as quickly as possible. Instead of waiting since, as you say, that will give the opposition time to get back and organise themselves. Just keep it moving.

1829~~~
He's playing those "low reward - high risk" -situations better than anyone. He just finds a way to use his speed to get out of trouble that oftej others have passed onto him. Playing behind Di Maria he has to keep his head going forward and still gets a couple of dangerous crosses in every game. Been very good this whole season, would look even better if Di Maria could support him with world-class performances..

1830~~~
solid, that's what he is , he can have a good game when anybody around him plays well or just solid game like he showed today. I'd like to see Rafael back tbh because Valencia is too predictable and can only play in one way. He's like robot currently working well so I guess it's thumb up for him.

1831~~~
And don´t forget those two long passes down the touchline, one to I think di Maria, and the other to Januzaj, were absolutely tits. Doesn´t get enough credit. Seems to work really well with di Maria or Januzaj on the wing, much as he did as a winger with a prime Rafael.

1832~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54rv_WgZcHQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe> Brilliant vid.

1833~~~
Criminally underrated this season. He is being knocked down on here because of his previous form last couple seasons. The man has turned a new leaf this year and has been excellent at the back this season. Hes fast, strong and his crossing is almost back to where it used to be. He is our best right back as far as im concerned.

1834~~~
I assume you mean under rated then.

1835~~~
Agreed, he's really bossing that side of the field in basically every match we play. Guess its Rafa's fans that refuse to accept that he's currently the better player and has rightfully earned his spot in the team. Nothing goes past Antonio, and unlike last season where he used to switch off and look clueless when defending he seems to understand the role now. Just simply a great fullback.

1836~~~
Yeah, he's been great. Still not quite the explosive outlet he was in 11/12, but I think he has adapted well to this new role, which is a credit to him after I'm sure we all expected he was done here from the form he showed in his previous two seasons. 

Defensively, I think he may be one of the most solid right backs around. Never loses a physical battle. His anticipation in one-on-one situations is seriously on point. Great tackler. His first touch is outrageously underrated. He controls bullet passes without breaking stride. He could control a medicine ball being shot right at him out of a cannon. He makes it look like nothing, and it barely gets a mention.

I love Rafael, but right now Valencia is the better option for us, in terms of remaining as defensively solid as possible. I think Rafael might give us a bit more potency in attack, but I don't think he's anywhere near as dominant defensively, nor as disciplined. He's one of the first names on the team sheet when naming our strongest 11, IMO.

1837~~~
I was one of Rafaels biggest fans. I would argue with other rival team fans about how good he is. He just really has t kicked on since that really great season he had. Injuries haven't helped but it kinda speaks volumes when only United fans rate a player. Valencia has earned his spot and I have full confidence in him. Rafael does bring some more directness and flair when he plays. But if you speak of consistency. That's valencia for you. At least this season.

1838~~~
The selfless warrior.

1839~~~
Every once in a while it seems someone posts about his poor first touch…makes me wonder if they've actually seen any matches.  Even back when Scholes was pinging 50-yard cross field passes, Valencia was always there to bring it down like he was using his hands.  Plenty of areas he can improve on - his first touch is not one.

1840~~~
This - the past 2 years (2012-2014) he seemed to have mysteriously lost plenty of confidence and you could see it in his reluctance to put balls in the air or attack (he let Rafael do that in 2012). But his first touch has always been great on his right foot and it would have to be with all the high, lofted balls Scholes and now Rooney send his way. He also is one of our best one-touch passers. I'm sure someone can find all the flicks he does when he played with Rafael or this season when the winger and him have been in sync. He still could work on 

(1) his shooting - he has a cannon but no real direction or technique to it.

(2) defensively he's been superb especially on covering blind runs which were what always caught him out 2-3 years ago when Fergie first played him at RB, but I think his SLIDE tackling can improve. His tackling on his feet his good but , as you expect of a converted winger, his sliding is still touch-and-go.

(3) his crossing - it's actually been great the past month, but I thinkhe could really use his left more. He's shown he can at least 2-3 times a season, but he needs to do it 2 times a game to make the defenders nervous.

1841~~~
Except for his crossing, he´s a brilliant passer.

1842~~~
I wonder if we can put the myth that he's a decent defender to bed?

1843~~~
Playing wingers at right back was always going to come back and bite us on the arse. And it did tonight.

1844~~~
Man of the Match for me. Yes he shouldn't have under hit the back pass but then why didn't Jones clear the fecking ball when he had the chance?. 

Apart from that though he hardly have sanchez a sniff and attacked well. Was solid all game imo.

1845~~~
Actually thought he was one of, if not the, worst player tonight. Looked so clueless defending that pretty much all of their threat came on our right hand side.

1846~~~
After I defend him and say hes been fantastic he goes and pulls that stunt. FFS

1847~~~
Disagree mate, I thought he was poor all-round. Passing was off, defending was very poor and did nothing going forward.

1848~~~
9 times out of 10 Valencia has performed well as our backup right back this season.

Tonight was a poor night where he clearly had to be subbed off before he did us too much harm to come back from. And its compounded by the fact that our best RB is fit and has been available without selection for a while. Which suggests that in LVG's mind Valencia is first choice RB

So in summary - a good enough backup RB, not a good enough first choice RB and it was a poor choice to pick him in such a big game and completely and utterly crazy to keep him on when he's out there having a mare.

1849~~~
Please feck off Valencia.

Best Regards,
A

1850~~~
What an absolutely horrible performance from him. I praised him earlier but today really showed his ability against a top player like Sanchez.

1851~~~
He's not good enough to be our long-term right back. He can mask his mistakes when we're controlling games by offering a decent attacking threat, but he's simply not a full-back overall, and it showed tonight. Horrendous error for the second goal.

1852~~~
What game were you watching?

1853~~~
I'd agree with this. I think he can be competent in the position against smaller teams, but unless it's completely necessarily, he really should not be playing there when we're up against top opposition because it's what results in him getting exposed.

1854~~~
If Rafael doesn't start the next game I've had it.

1855~~~
This.

Had a mare out there.

1856~~~
Yeah, I'd agree with that too.

I just hate him though, even when he was a good winger a couple years back I hated him. His whole limited style of play gets on my nerves and his bloody throw-ins.

1857~~~
How has a guy so out of his depth for so much of his time at United managed to play so many fecking games?

1858~~~
He's a wingback, he's a winger but not a fullback. End of debate.

1859~~~
He's a mediocre winger and a subpar wing-back. He tries hard, god bless him but it's just not there. At least Rafael has some fecking talent.

1860~~~
He's not a winger either. He's just fecking shite and should be sold asap.

1861~~~
Nail in the coffin tonight. His mistake leaves us out of the cup. Culpable for the first goal too but the second was unforgivable. 

He's not nearly good enough to be our first choice full back or right midfielder. Thanks for the service, but it's time to go.

1862~~~
Was shown up drastically but he has been solid up until now though. Unfortunately it happened in a big game. The under hit backpass was awful.

1863~~~
You give this shit on my birthday..  
I never want to see you again.. #@Rafaelin

1864~~~
really? Sanchez ran at him at will, he was one of the worst players on the pitch and that's before the backpass. I shat myself everytime Sanchez went 1-on-1 against him.

1865~~~
Considering Rafael is out of favour we are surely in the hunt for a right back in the summer anyway. I expect Valencia will still be around as backup, which is fine. Cost us tonight though the silly buggar.

1866~~~
Fingers well and truly fecking crossed.

1867~~~
Exactly this. Was actually shocked by the amount of people defending him even up until a few days ago. Players like him, Fellaini, Jones and co. are why we are stagnating in a big way.

1868~~~
That's he effect good players have, hazard is the same. I thought he generally did well though unless he let him get turned and running, but then everybody would find that tough.

1869~~~
How many times has that been said? he'll start our next game and the ten after that.

1870~~~
Thought he had a good game if you ignore him being mainly at fault for both goals. Unfortunately you can't ignore that. All over the place and way too soft in the tackle for their first, and then the second was just an under hit back pass. It happens, but it's cost us the result today.

1871~~~
After today's performance it's clear even he wants Rafael to start.

1872~~~
Man of the Match for this game. For Arsenal.

1873~~~
Sorry. I agree with you. I meant it should be the nail in the coffin. But it won't.

1874~~~
I can only imagine the excuses that would be made for Rafael if he made the same mistake. Nice to see people couldn't wait for their opportunity to pounce. This place really is a sad indictment on Utd fans at times.

1875~~~
LVG said he was our MOTM tonight.

1876~~~
If Van Gaal has any self-decency, he should 1) say nothing about Valencia and 2) throw a boot right above Valencia's eye to make it self-explanatory about what he thinks.

1877~~~
Really?!

1878~~~
Not sure what van Gaal was on about in his post-game praise of Valencia.

1879~~~

1880~~~
As much as I believe in the guy, LVG does talk a lot of nonsense most of the time

1881~~~
He was brilliant imo apart from the bacm pass (not that this is some minor thing), really felt for him because he played very good.

1882~~~
It's not nail in the coffin though, is it? 

Bad mistakes but find it hard to criticise him too much, being played out of position and usually performs to a pretty good level. We all want Rafa to be first choice though, want to see him back in the team soon.

1883~~~
He isn't a good enough player to be at United.  

He was at fault during both the goals conceded tonight.  Not damning in itself, but he doesn't add anything to us to make up for it and hasn't in a long time.  

What he was doing for the first goal, I don't know.  Turning round in to someone instead of keeping an eye on the ball and going for it?

1884~~~
He hasn't played at a pretty good level for ages (one season where he did?).  All he's added since is filling the space on the pitch.

1885~~~
The second goal was an atrocious mistake for any professional footballer to make. 

The first goal highlighted is defensive naivety. He's not good enough and that's not based on tonight. It just served to highlight his limitations.

1886~~~
I disagree. Although it's a shame that the player we have now barely resembles that monstrous winger we used to have, he's been reliable and a pretty consistent performer while playing right back this year for me. Rafa should start every game and it's one of the issues I have with van Gaal that he doesn't get a look-in but I find that hard to hold against Valencia.

1887~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1888~~~
No really, some really good interceptions/tackles and dragged the ball from behind in midfield with his pace and power, I thought he handled Sanchez really wel. But ofcourse make a mistake and you turn into shit.

1889~~~
We can blame him for a bad pass-back but many players have done that before. It's one of these things. The first goal was mainly Di Maria's fault for me.

What I cannot abide is the utter lack of urgency and chances we created for the 34 minutes which proceeded that error.

1890~~~
By the end he was a bundle of nerves and petrified of Sanchez. I think that mistake broke him, he's usually far more composed.

1891~~~
I thought it looked liked he had been given an order to follow Sanchez wherever he went - which seemed to backfire as he then found himself charging round the pitch like a madman, and constantly being out of position.

1892~~~
Are people on a windup? Even before their first goal he was too easily beaten 4 times and it only got worse from there.

I can only think LvG is trying to limit the damage to his confidence, either that or he's puffing the magic dragon

1893~~~
Good in the first half, but after the changes, he looked shite like everyone else. Playing a foreign system in a foreign position is hard.

1894~~~
I was thinking more the absolute lack of presence as a defensive figure, which allowed most of Arsenal's attack to come through our right hand side. If that was a "brilliant" performance then I severely worry for the future of our defence.

1895~~~
For me, the first goal is not his fault. If your full back is tucked in, the onus is on the winger to drop deeper and slot in. Di Maria was asleep and did not react to the danger in the slightest.

Of course the second is inexcusable really. But he did have another decent game on the whole, and LVG said as much.

1896~~~
Apart from his mistake, I thought he was really good. I think the first goal, where he tucked in too much could have been covered by Smalling, who swapped places with Valencia. Di Maria could have also followed Monreal, too.

1897~~~
Valencia was watching Monreal and then just decided to run inside instead. He needs to be talking to Di Maria and telling him to drop back if he does decide to do that and it didn't look like there was any communication between them to me.

1898~~~
Definitely mate, Arsenal's best player tonight. Put Monreal's and Welbeck's goals on a plate for them and he was a defensive rock for them as well stifling most of United's attacks.

1899~~~
What about saying to himself "feck it" and try someone else at RB instead? Until further notice, we have 2 natural defenders who can play there (Rafael and McNair) and we all know how important it is in any discipline to play a natural defender at the back.

If Van Gaal appears to have no qualms destroying others' confidence, I don't see why he couldn't do the same with Valencia.

1900~~~
This guy is a joke. I'm no coach but sitting there tonight on several occasions this lad was way way out of position. Like, seriously, the feck was he playing at? I can just about take his poor attacking play but the lad was all over the place.

Di Maria didn't track back either which didn't help him at all.

1901~~~
His performances have improved this season, but he really fecked it up today.

1902~~~
I like Valencia, or at least the player he was but he is rapidly becoming an ever more pointless footballer. Can't defend all that well and he's toothless going forward not a good combination really.

But to be fair he is really good at receiving the ball turning round and passing it short to whoever's close to him, usually the player who just gave it to him. Other than this he doesn't offer much.

He was shocking tonight.

1903~~~
I wouldn't go as far as say that his performances improved. He fit for a role for some time as a wingback, but that appeared to be borrowed time more than anything else.

1904~~~
** - it was a bad day fr AV and several others. It just cost us.

1905~~~
Playing a right winger at right back and a winger who doesn't track back at right wing was going to end in a disaster to be honest

1906~~~
He's not a right back. He's an absolutely finished right midfielder who has nothing to offer going forward who for some reason has been asked to play right back while Rafael sits on his hole.

1907~~~
He hasn't been particularly bad, sure, but I just don't think he's been anything really.   
Recently I've started to really look at what players genuinely add to the team.  And Valencia in any position, IMO, simply fills a gap.  He does it, usually, without doing anything too terrible and he is consistent in that.  Thats not what I want personally.  I want players that can contribute to the kind of football that we want.  A RB needs to be solid in defence, but also needs to be able to contribute well with going forward too.  Valencia just seems to be there without ever really offering anything.

That being said, there are probably more important areas to sort out first, so long as performances like tonight aren't a regular thing.

1908~~~
Simply put, he doesnt make that <i>stupid</i> pass, we'd still be in the cup and not about to go 3 seasons without silverware. Totally unforgivable.

1909~~~
I'm pretty sure that this lead to the first goal, as he was chasing down Sanchez and remained out of position the entire time. Smalling covered for a while, however, both decided to play right center back, and allowed Monreal time and space to score.

1910~~~
LVG must be justifying freezing out Rafael. Rooney was our best player after DDG. 

Saying Valencia was MOTM is pretty dumb

1911~~~
Obviously I'm one of Rafael's fans and Valencia was at fault for both goals but I'm not going to start slinging shit at him on the back of the two mistakes. He isn't a right back (that doesn't excuse the simple errors) but he is just not a right back and you have to accept mistakes are going to happen when you play someone out of position for that long.

1912~~~
Or maybe he was deflecting blame off Valencia like he always does and always will for any player as van Gaal does single out players as individuals.

1913~~~
Realistically, We were slight underdogs against Arsenal at the time of the mistake (30 minutes or so to go at home vs 90 or 120 away), and Liverpool are still in the competition so even if you only give Villa and the winner of Bradford-Reading a combined 5 percent chance of winning the cup, you'd still have to say we were a hair under 25 percent at most to win it (guesstimate: Arsenal 27, United 23, Liverpool 45, Blackburn/Villa/Bradford/Reading 5).

It was an awful mistake, though.

1914~~~
2 seasons... We won the title in 2013

1915~~~
I don't see how he has displaced a more talented winger(Nani) and a more talented right back(Rafael). You'd think maybe it's this one manager. No, this is the third manager in a row who has preferred him. Is it because he's just 'hard working' now? From 09-12(ish) he was great. Starting from 2012/13 he's completely regressed as a footballer.

1916~~~
Poor tactical decision to have him man mark a free role'd Sanchez. He was pulled all over the pitch and in result had himself exhausted mentally and physically.

1917~~~
I'm sick of him. He's reasonably quick and strong, but other than that he offers nothing. His crossing is poor, doesn't score goals and because he has no left foot he ends up turning backwards WAY too much. He's a decent backup player to have in the squad but he shouldn't be starting, and right now I wouldn't care if he never played for United again. Really hope Rafael is given another chance, he is so much better than Valencia.

1918~~~
He let him come inside onto his right foot every single time, which is exactly what he wanted to do. If Valencia was putting up any sort of fight Sanchez would have had to go outside onto his left foot a few times to get the ball past him, but he didnt need to do that at all. And this is the third of the game that he was actually in his right back position. For the other two thirds of the game Sanchez didnt have to beat him because he wasnt there

1919~~~
He made many and cant make up for them with a couple of good tackles. Those good tackles need to be on top of defending well over 90 minutes and not making individual errors <b>not instead</b> of them

1920~~~
Personally I don't blame Valencia, he only plays where he's told to play by the manager. He's not a defender and the whole world minus one person knows that.

1921~~~
He was bad, really bad and this without the suicidal back pass. Sanchez scared him to death him.

1922~~~
Terrible pass to gift Welbeck a goal. That said, I think he did ok apart from that, and I think he's done very well at RB a lot this season. His form up to tonight has been very consistent, and he's been very reliable. Not all that going forward, but usually very solid defensively. If it wasn't for the gift of a goal, I don't think we'd be here calling him all the names under the sun.

He had a tough job tonight against Sanchez, who will make mincemeat of just about any fullback. Getting rinsed by one of the best wide forwards in the world doesn't immediately make you a terrible defender, but even then, Valencia gave as good as he got in that respect. Some good tackles and interceptions. The first goal was more on Di Maria for me, as the opposing fullback is the wingers man, and Di Maria just stood on the edge of the box, marking no one.

Di Maria needed to help Valencia out, which he often didn't do, and Monreal and Sanchez had too much space to run into. They did Valencia in 2 on 1 situations more than once, and you can't really blame Valencia for that.

1923~~~
He's terrible. People have got so used to him being dogshite for the last 2 years that an average performance looks like a good one.

1924~~~
Got to agree with that, especially that Valencia was often left 1v2 as another fecking star-performer from yesterday didn't bother tracking back for shit, when you'd expect Sanchez alone to be doubled most of the game.

1925~~~
If I'm honest I really thought he had been improving lately in that position. But yesterday his back pass was pathetic and he got destroyed continually by Sanchez.

1926~~~
Cant really hold him responsible entirely. He is a winger not a defender. More the manager's fault for playing him there.

1927~~~
To be fair he was moved as RB partly because we needed him there (Rafael is a crock) and partly because he's as effective as a winger as Philip Neville was. His tricks had been long learnt.

1928~~~
Just watched LvGs post match presser on MUTV. He says Valencia was our best player, and it doesn't look like he's just saying it to prevent him losing confidence either. I think he genuinely means it. It's disappointing but he will be starting every game at RB for us whilst Rafael continues to be shunned inexplicably. What Valencia has in pace and power he lacks in agility.

1929~~~
Too many people here are not looking at the bigger picture. It's not Valencia's fault we lost, it was the lack of urgency in the 34 minutes which came after Welbeck's winner.

If it was scored in the 89th minute, then fine, AV fecked up. But it was scored in the 61st minute. We had a third of the match left to score and I'm not sure we had another shot in this time.

1930~~~
I'm mad at him. He's been suspect defensively yesterday. He's been bad recently but yesterday was an absolute poor performance by him. He hasn't been helped much by Di Maria in his channel but he's been poor. 

I mad at LVG to continuously putting him at right back, we he could assess the problem earlier with either Rafael, or even Jones at this position

1931~~~
I don't think anyone is literally saying it is 100% his fault. But he is a large part responsible. 

And your logic is silly as you're basically saying anything that happens doesn't mean anything because it's not right at the end.

1932~~~
My point is players make mistakes and we had ample time to rectify the situation, but didn't look arsed enough.

1933~~~
I just can't fecking stand to watch Antonio Valencia play football for Manchester United. How can you make £70k a week and NOT BE ABLE TO KICK THE BALL WITH YOUR LEFT FOOT. He's a fecking donkey with the lungs of a cheetah who's bored with hunting antelope all day and would rather give a little chase and let them run back to their herd. Plus you'd think his cat died each and every morning. I've never seen a more miserable looking human being. Shit on you, Antonio Valencia.

1934~~~
This is all spot on. Horrendous error but overall a decent display. Especially considering he was a one man defence against Arsenal's best player, thanks to the half-arsed display by our right winger. Don't think Sanchez managed to dribble him once. Not many PL fullbacks can say that.

1935~~~
I thought he played ok bar the mistake and some positioning errors, understandably considering he is not a right back.

I would give him a run on the wing though and get Rafa back, not gonna happen mind.

1936~~~
Wtf is this shit. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1938~~~
Well, this is more or less what everyone thinks of Antonio Valencia deep within.

1939~~~
Valencia was involved in both their of their goals which is bad but other than that he was one of our best players on the field last night.
He had to defend against Sanchez but still was eager to go forward and was involved in many decent attacks.  

I really don't get the stubborn Valencia hatred here, get over it thank you.

1940~~~
True, I had a nice sleep, looked their 1st goal again and Di Maria was just strolling around while watching Monreal make a run, he didnt even try to stop him....

1941~~~
Nah, its just a crazy post.

1942~~~
Unbelievable. SAF did it a few times, Moyes made it a habit, and LVG has made it dogma. Every single time his weaknesses are there to see. He is NOT a RB, a single game watching him against semi-decent opposition will tell you that.
His positioning is always atrocious. He contests the wrong headers and makes tackles in the wrong place. He gets easily dragged out of position. His one-footedness makes it tough to play out from the back. I always look over to our right side of defence when he plays and always I see open space, a switch of play, and him scrambling to get in position from wherever he had got dragged off to. It's a disaster to watch, and I don't see how any of these coaches (but especially Moyes and LVG) don't see the harm he does from that position.

1943~~~
He just had an awful game, which happens to everyone. He's been mostly solid this season but clearly wasn't prepared to face Sanchez. Had no idea how to cope with him all game and acted like he had never watched Sanchez play (mostly showing him inside on his stronger foot). He was fine on the ball though, minus the complete brain fart that cost us the game.

That said the setup wasn't exactly beneficial to him. Having our most attacking, defensively lazy player in front of him against Arsenal's best and trickiest player was always going to end poorly. If that were our plan going in Van Gaal should have instructed our central midfielders to focus heavily on tracking Sanchez.

1944~~~
He made a mistake for the pass back (Jones is also part culpable) but over all I thought he played very well.

1945~~~
Yeah, the bit where he disappeared for their first goal, and the time he gave away a stupid free kick in the edge of our box were real highlights for me.

1946~~~
Something about the photo of Valencia at the top of the page just makes me laugh. Its like he's contemplating on his latest mistake.

1947~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what is this?

1948~~~
How so? Because he ordered Val to make a basic 15 yard pass?

1949~~~
See this I am sorry is just B.S. If Blind, Smalling, Shaw or Rojo would have put a damn tackle in on Chamberlain it wouldn't have been an issue. Instead he danced through 4 players, which then sucked Valencia in to close down the space. Unfortunately for him he also had an overlapping fullback which Di Maria did feck all to track, and left that side of the box wide open. Many many things went wrong in that goal before you can blame Valencia. Yes OK he could have maybe stood his ground better but positioning and decision making is probably the most important attribute a defender needs. Valencia clearly lacks that a little. 

I am quite surprised reading this thread how many people thought he was completely rubbish. I think a lot of people are very upset he made the backpass mistake, and it's clouding the overall judgement. I am not surprised Van Gaal thought he was MOTM as apart from those 2 incidents he was solid in my eyes all game.

People saying "but Sanchez had him scared all game". Sanchez scares every defender in the league! that type of speed and balance is not easy to play against whoever you are.

1950~~~
He should have cleared the ball himself. Why pass the ball 5 yards to a team mate who isn't ready for the ball?. It's cowardly to pass responsibility on like that. Instead of clearing the ball first time, he takes a crap chest control and then put's his team mate in hot water. 

I can guarantee you now if that was Smalling or Rojo they would have bashed that upfield first time, and we would still be in the game.

1951~~~
Gets picked continually over better players, first Nani, now Rafael. I don't know how he does it, but he "works hard". He was beyond terrible yesterday.

1952~~~
I don't blame Jones though. He's incredibly thick and still, he's getting picked. If Shaw was injured, Van Gaal could have simply moved Blind to left back, and used Carrick in midfield along with Herrera. Instead, he brought on Jones, and disrupted the entire backline.

1953~~~
Bingo. 

That and the underlying resentment from Rafael fans.

1954~~~
It was mis-controlled on his chest slightly so it fell to Valencia's foot, are you seriously telling me that Valencia should not be capable of tidying up there? 'Give me the ball back Val, I am no coward'....

You mean like when Smalling failed to control a simple ball, and fell over to boot, putting Arsenal through on goal?

Val made more tackles than any other player on the pitch and was decent going forward. Sanchez still gave him a torrid time and he made some very bad positional errors too. It was a mixed bag for me but he looked like a winger playing at right back too often.

1955~~~
That is perhaps the case for some people. I still think he was all over the place with his positioning in general though and that it wasn't a very good game from him.

1956~~~
He's a good player to have, and a competent RB, but we should really be starting with Rafael and using Tony as our backup RB.

1957~~~
he's a fecking shit winger nowadays too though, if he was remotely good enough there maybe we wouldn't be talking about him as a right-back at all.

1958~~~
Again, I will say it's not his fault he was out of position often - it looked like he was told to follow Sanchez around and that's what he did (and that wasn't a good strategy, but it's hardly his call is it?)

1959~~~
Bad mistake that cost us dearly, however I echo what others in here have said in that up until then I thought he was actually having a decent game. The changes at half time ruined the whole rhythm and balance of the entire team but up until then he was fine. Got forward a lot and wasn't just doing his usual 'smash it low and hard' into the box type crosses. He linked up well with Di Maria. Also he dealt with a quality wide player in Sanchez very well.

The mistake cost us, no doubt about it, but he was one of the better players when you look at the whole match and not that one incident. 

And I'm a big Rafael fan!

1960~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/FhtSrN0.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/FhtSrN0.jpg"/>

1961~~~
I don't think Sanchez played that well, and Tony dealt with him ok.

Stupid for the back pass, but has to share the blame for that with the new Duncan Edwards Phil Jones. 

I can't even remember the first goal perfectly, but the fact Oxlade-Chamberlain skipped past a few players before scoring is embarasing. Someone should of just took the ball off of him. We lack a physical presence in midfield big time.. (sign Wanyama please...)

1962~~~
Yeah, Blind went to ground with a pathetic effort.

1963~~~
People are concentrating too much on the back pass and not enough on why Jones decided to chest the ball 5 yards to him instead of dealing with it himself. Easy to berate the mistake itself but atleast look at what caused the mistake to come about. 

Seriously, imagine chesting the ball down to your teammate who is hugely under pressure with no immediate options. Silly from Jones. It's more on him than Valencia for me.

1964~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/FhtSrN0.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/FhtSrN0.jpg"/>

Lets not be too harsh. 


<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1965~~~
It was not a difficult pass to execute. Valencia is at fault.

1966~~~
That doesn't matter. Look at the reason for the mistake - which is Jones taking unnecessary risks and putting him under pressure.

Some people are so quick to blame players for no reason. Its quite embarrassing.

1967~~~
For no reason? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1968~~~
OK, ignore the whole context of both my posts and pick up on something which you can take issue with.

Tell me why you're so intent on blaming Valencia for making a mistake when being placed under great pressure from a position which Jones forced him into.

1969~~~
Because it was a shit attempt at a back pass.

1970~~~
No reason? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Bloody hell, the pass was absolutely diabolical and van Gaal definitely tore him a new one after the match. Rightfully so, He should never have given their forward a chance to score. 

That said, he fecked up - let's move on.

1971~~~
Valencia is the fall guy, somebody to point blame at. If Jones heads that ball up pitch first time without trying to be clever it would never have got that far.

Perhaps the "philosophy" is ultimately to blame, but Jones needs to realise they are already being tightly shut down, that's not a time to try and control the ball and play at the back. Decision making is what we suck at.

1972~~~
So its clear you both can't actually see why Jones is at fault here. Always an issue with this place and football fans in general - people always see the mistake and get all blind with rage, rather than opening their eyes and looking objectively at the situation. 

But by all means, continue to hate on a player for making a mistake under pressure instead of the player who gave the ball to his under pressure teammate in a risky manner, whilst under no pressure of his own.

1973~~~
Let's see how many people take issue at this post now. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1974~~~
Unbelievable, is this for real or am I just falling for a massive WUM?

He's hardly under any pressure, he's facing towards De Gea already and the ball come nicely to his feet.  

There's no need for Jones to hoof it, that's not what our defenders have been doing all season.  Given that he was taking it on the move, and had an unmarked team-mate a few feet away, laying it off was a perfectly reasonable thing to do.  And yet somehow it is his fault ahead of the guy who totally, completely fecked up a simple back-pass?!<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

You can debate the rest of Valencia's performance all you like, but to try and shift blame for that goal is mental, and the worst kind of favouritism / Jones-bashing.

1975~~~
His positioning reminds me of Rafael during his first season, always wants to close down the ball, which is why he went sprinting off towards Oxlade Chamberlin leaving the left wing exposed.

1976~~~
Yeah, I agree. It's the referee's fault for kicking the game off. If he doesn't do that Valencia would never have passed the ball back.

1977~~~
I'm not blind with rage.. Yeah Jones didn't to his job well either - but ultimately it was Valencia who fecked up. He made a huge mistake. However, I don't give a shit anymore, just be thankful it was the cup.

1978~~~
Yes Jones could have dealt with it. That does not excuse Valencia for what he did. Are you actually saying he couldn't have done any better with that pass? How am I even arguing about this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1979~~~
I suggest we all let it go <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1980~~~
I think he was halfway there, and then Shaw slipped so he decided to go the whole way to cover for him.

1981~~~
It doesn't. But neither does it explain why Jones felt the need to do all that stuff himself anyway. Again, look at the cause rather than the mistake itself. I bet you're the sort of guy who would berate a GK for letting a penalty slip through his fingers while not even mentioning the defender who handled the ball in the area...

I've also not said anywhere that he couldn't have done better. But please continue to try to take the piss out of what I'm saying and try to take the high ground.

1982~~~
Jones didn't even mean to chest it to him. It was just a rubbish chest control as you can tell by the way he initially went to chase it. He then realised Valencia was there & backed off.

Not excusing Valencia at all. It was a horrific backpass & the fault is squarely on him but it was still a bad bit of play from Jones.

1983~~~
You said people were blaming Val for no reason. There obviously is a reason then.

You're talking shit.

Discussion over.

1984~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Mental, absolutely mental.  

To be clear, for this analogy to work, Jones is the goalie and Valencia is the hand-balling defender.  Ie, Jones could maybe have done better, but it was Valencia that made the massive cock-up.

So, maybe it's you that is "the sort of guy" who would do that?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1985~~~
OK. Maybe one day you'll actually engage in a discussion with someone and answer their points rather than try to pick at a few words they've said, use a few <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> smilys and an attempt at a witty backhanded comment.

1986~~~
Someone else who loves to use smilies to speak down on someone else's points. 

Just like iBoss, either answer the points in my post or don't bother responding. All these attempts to put me and my points down just make you both look quite rude and childish, really.

1987~~~
That was the first time in a while I can remember Antonio having a bad game at RB. He'll bounce back.

1988~~~
Think it's abit harsh to put all the blame on him. It was a poor decision by Jones to chest it down to him, especially with Valencia facing him, he should of dealt with the danger. But it was very poor by Valencia as well but everyone makes them mistakes, even the very best players, it's just unfortunate that it cost us the game in such a big tie.

Apart from that though, he dealt with Sanchez quite well at times. The first goal, he drifted inside and Smalling went to RB but then Smalling decided to come back to CB even though Valencia was still inside. I doubt if Shaw or Rafael had had the same game, people would be on their back as much. Valencia has been good at RB for me, and one game won't change that, I'm not going to judge his RB form based on what he has done as a winger over the last year.

1989~~~
<b>Please keep the conversations civil and don't use insults, folks.</b>

1990~~~
Bizarre, isn't it?

1991~~~
Feel sorry for him, he's clearly hurting judging by his Facebook post, hope we don't see his confidence drop because he's horrendous when his confidence is low.

1992~~~
Apologies - after Waldner twice moved the debate away from our opinions of what happened and on to what "sort of person" I am, I seem to ahve got dragged down to doing the same.  Will not happen again.

1993~~~
Antonio Valencia, seen here hugely under pressure with no immediate options:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i1072.photobucket.com/albums/w365/Aidan_Grant/Tony_zpszwi5g2fc.png" src="http://i1072.photobucket.com/albums/w365/Aidan_Grant/Tony_zpszwi5g2fc.png"/>

1994~~~
You mean to say the recent Valencia was high on confidence? fecking hell. We're fecked.

1995~~~
He's been solid enough this season, I've been happy with his overall contribution and I would continue to play him 'til we sign a new right-back.

1996~~~
Apart form Val obviously fecking up, what the hell is Edwards mkII doing there? Not only running in Valencia's way but also pointing hysterically back to DDG instead of probably getting into a position to pass the ball to.

1997~~~
It was an outrageously poor mistake but that happens from time to time. He wasn't our worst player at all last night. He clearly cares deeply, and that Facebook post makes me feel bad for him. Hopefully the manager can put an arm around him, let him know he still has faith and Tony can recover. With LvG's man-management skills, though, I'm not so sure that'll happen!

1998~~~
If you could refrain from making personal judgments about other caf members, I'd like to point out that I've already explained why your views on this incident are mental.

You chose to blame somebody who made <i>possibly </i>the wrong decision (but nothing worse than happened all over the pitch all evening and far from catastrophic) ahead of somebody who made a monumental cock-up that cost us the match.  And then, to compound the weirdness, you accuse <i>other people </i>of blaming the player who made the minor mistake.  It's really all quite strange.

1999~~~
Not sure what your point is.  Having made the chest down (rightly or wrongly), the pass-back to De Gea was definitely the correct choice for Valencia, which presumably is why Jones is signalling to Valencia to do so.

2000~~~
But why, when we have Rafael?  

I'm resigned to the fact that we won't be seeing Rafael again, but it's far from being a decision I agree with.  I know who I'd play if I was the manager.

2001~~~
Just to be clear, this is allowed, yeah?

2002~~~
What I noticed yesterday is that Smalling and Jones werent exactly running like mad men after they saw that backpass cause they thought DDG will deal with it and when they saw he wont they started running more quickly but it was too late. If they started running to cover the goal right away or close Welbeck maybe they could have deal with it.

2003~~~
Most of us would play Rafael, yes, but obviously van Gaal has his reasoning. I still suspect Giggs may have had an impact on Rafael's position in the squad, because van Gaal has continued to play all our other injury prone defenders. Pure speculation on my part. Also, wasn't there talk of a player sending around a video of a woman performing a sexual act on himself within the dressing room? Again, pure speculation on my part. I don't know why he's been frozen out but he has.

2004~~~
LVG taking stick but that's man management. So why people give him stick i'll never know. If Valencia is fine he won't be dropped. I don't think LVG will want to kick a man when he's down.

2005~~~
Is there a reason to think Giggs is particularly anti-Rafael then?

If it's the one I'm thinking of it was other players secretly filming a player doing sex stuff in a nightclub toilet, and sending it round.  But yeah, not to say he wasn't involved, either as the sexed one or the voyer camera-man / distibrutor.

2006~~~
That's kind of natural though.  When a team-mate plays a straight forward backpass to the keeper, your instinct isn't and shouldn't be to charge after it at full pelt.  It was only as they realised how badly he'd hit it that they started to sprint back.

2007~~~
Rafael better start against Spurs.

2008~~~
No real reasoning, just that Giggs has worked with Rafael for many years and he would know all about his injury problems. We haven't seen Smalling, Jones or Evans frozen out by van Gaal, even though they're equally as frustrating with their injuries. I dunno why Rafael's been treated any differently to them.

2009~~~
He wont.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2010~~~
Yeah i'm sure Val will get a chance to redeem himself but when push comes to shove against another top quality side he'll get found out again.  Same with Evans & Jones.

2011~~~
Yeah but if you see a forward getting that backpass and running to your goal then you should charge at full pelt. That's what I meant.

2012~~~
I thought he had a decent game. Dealt with Sanchez reasonably well. The first goal wasnt entirely his fault either. Sanchez was running free so he followed his man. Although this meant he was out of position, he was still covering for 1 of the CB. The fault is more of Di Maria who should've covered the space vacated by Valencia but stood there ball watching. 
2nd goal was just an underhit back pass. We've seen that happen to even world class defenders.

2013~~~
A winger playing a RB + no help from Di Maria whole freaking game,constant left 1v1 and people go full out at him? For those who might come out and say how we had Rafael on the bench,he would not last 60 minute without being sent off in same scenario.

2014~~~
Are we still doing this Rafael is too rash stuff?

2015~~~
I think Jones deserves as much as the blame for the 2nd goal as Valencia. There was no reason for Jones to chest the ball down to Valencia in that situation. Head it away and the danger is gone. Instead, he chests it down to Valencia to restart the Jones - Smalling - Blind - De Gea passing loop.

2016~~~
Despite his two errors for the goals, I actually thought his effort and general play was spot on. Real shame about the errors.

2017~~~
Last night it was hot and he is hot headed even he sleeps.For real tho,i think that he would not last whole game,thats my opinion, and no i am not doing Rafa is too rash stuff,its just my opinion.

2018~~~
That's not the case anymore.

2019~~~
He's a right back now, and has defended like a good one until last night. He isn't a winger anymore. If he is then he'll sharp find himself lower down the food chain and considerably so.

He showed Sanchez onto his right foot incessantly. It doesn't matter a jot how often he got beat one vs one. He was wildly out of position for most of the match and gave Sanchez plenty of joy.

2020~~~
Well,he does not get games to prove any views,hope you are right for his sake.

2021~~~
He didn't appear to have such qualms following the Leicester match, whereupon he proceeded to blame Rafael for the Vardy dive. He has also singled out other players publicly, McNair and Blackett being but two of these.

2022~~~
Thank you for taking the time out to respond to a post in a semi-constructive way.

Right. As soon as Jones chests it to Valencia, you can see Sanchez smell blood and close him down. It's not like he was miles away from him when he chests it to him as well. He had Sanchez reasonably close to him who immediately sprints to pressure him when the chest pass is made. The pass is then crucially underhit from Valencia whilst he was under pressure from a sprinting Sanchez. All of that makes the chest pass the key mistake there. Yes, the backpass was a poor one, but it wasn't the first mistake made in the chain of errors. If Jones doesn't attempt that pass (there were probably about 3/4 other options he has there) then Val doesn't mess up the pass. So for me, that's the crucial mistake.

As someone else said on this thread recently, even the best defenders in the world make that kind of error when under pressure from a sprinting defender. It's hardly the rarest or stupidest of mistakes, you see them at least a good few times a season. But it's more <i>constructive</i> to look at why Valencia even had to play that pass, as in why he was even under pressure in the first place, than to simply blame him for making the mistake outright.

I don't see your point here. Also, 3/4 other people have now echoed my thoughts RE. Jones since I made my first post in here. Strange how you and <a class="username" data-user="65160, @iBoss" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65160/">@iBoss</a> don't pick them up on it though, isn't it...

2023~~~
He is though.  The rest of your post may make sense if he was under genuine pressure, but by the time the ball is half way to him, Sanchez is only just entering the frame.  In the final image, Valencia has already played the ball, and still Sanchez 3 or 4 metres away.  I'm not even convinced Valencia was particularly aware he was there!

Yes, we see this happen a few times a season, I'm not trying to make out this is unprecedented in it's shiteness.  But (unless there actually is genuine pressure on the player) it is always the fault of the man who plays the atrocious back-pass, not the guy who gave it to him.

2024~~~
That's still not far. 3 metres is nothing when you've got a professional footballer sprinting at you. It's what, 2/3 strides? Valencia probably didn't expect Jones to come to such a stupid decision and wasn't mentally prepared to deal with the ball when it came to him. Mistake from him, granted, but the fact still remains that <i>if Jones hadn't attempted that play, Valencia wouldn't have needed to attempt the backpass</i>.

2025~~~
With DiMaria out, it would give LVG the opportunity to move Valencia up and play Rafael.  But my instinct tells me DiMaria will be replaced straight up with Januzaj.

2026~~~
Since reading these comments, I took a look at the replay again and again and again.  Sure Valencia's pass was  poor, but what was  Phil Jones thinking?  Sometimes you just need to hoof the ball out of danger.  Jones's other option was to play the ball out to right wing.

As bad as this was, it could have been worse.  What if DDG brought down Welbeck and was red carded?  Sure  Arsenal would only get a free kick but United would be without their saviour for three league matches.

2027~~~
You can go back and reach the ref blowing the whistle to kick off the game this way. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the pass, we now have a manager that wants players to play the ball rather than punting them long. The back pass was atrocious, there's no defending that.

2028~~~
Well, you could, if you wanted to be pedantic. Or you could instead approach the issue sensibly and realise that Jones had 3/4 different/better options to deal with that high ball than chesting it down to Valencia. People in this thread can choose to be narrow-minded, look at the back pass and say 'That's it, that's the only problem here' or they can be forward thinking, think a little bit constructively along the lines of 'Ok Valencia fecked up, but why was he put into that position? Why has he been given the ball there?'. Suddenly you see things in a different light.

It's very, very easy to blame Valencia and then close the case.

2029~~~
It isnt forward thinking or constructive to think all that, its just finding an excuse to not blame the guy. It wasn't a tough pass to deal with at all. All Valencia had to do was not feck up a simple back pass. You make it sound as if he was given the ball surrounded by couple of Arsenal players which wasnt the case. Neither was it passed to him at pace making it tough to control and pass it back. It was a simply lay up, take 1 touch, pass it back and we're sound.

2030~~~
It is. At the moment, you're the one taking every possible reason not to lay any blame on Jones and lay it all on Valencia instead. It's not hard to agree to the point of view that they both made a mistake, however Valencia wouldn't have had the opportunity to make a mistake had Jones not made his.

I'd rather not discuss this with you further if all you're going to do is repeat the same thing people before you have been saying to me, Varun. It's clear you and many others here either lack the ability to think beyond one mistake (unlikely), or that people just dislike Valencia/love Jones and so want to protect/criticise them as much as possible. I'm not going to get anywhere debating with people who have such concrete views.

2031~~~
There's absolutely nothing to dislike about Valencia nor anything lovable about Jones but yeah, if the only other reason why I could be saying what I am is the part in bold, its better not to discuss this with you.

2032~~~
Yep I suggest you get over it! We have been watching Rafael do this for 10 games a year for the last half a dozen seasons!

2033~~~
No the fact he tried to play and fecked up when it was clearly not on to play. It wouldn't matter if Valencia had hit that pass back to DDG to clear, Jones was still a muppet for trying to play when it was not on.

2034~~~
He gets picked as he's consistently better simple.

2035~~~
I fully blame Di Maria for the first goal as he just stood there without any intent of defending when he easily could have fallen down into defense and intercepted. Valencia was horrible for their second, but bar that stupid mistake he actually had a good game. It's refreshing to see him run at defenders more, and he gave Sanchez nothing down that wing as Valencia both outpaced and outmuscled him a few times. 

I too would give Rafael game time, but I'm wondering if Valencia should be allowed to play ahead of Rafael actually.

And another thing onthat first goal.  Watch daily Blind.  he gives Chamberline the goal side.
I'll post the replay.  Both were poor passes.  Jones had the option of playing that ball to the RW/RM position.  He could have even played that ball over  Arsenal's LB (Monreal?).

If I thought that they would learn from this, I would feel better.  Sadly, I'm not confident of that happening.

2038~~~
Di Maria could have just given Smalling a shout to stay with Monreal.  but there was no communication.  There were so many errors on that goal.

I'd also like to see Valencia back at RM.

2039~~~
I'll ask you two simple questions.  Why did Jones pass to Valencia?  What option did you think Jones though Valencia had once he received the ball?

2040~~~
Van Gaal wants the players to play, that is his MO. Granted Jones mis-controlled but the ball landed nicely at Valencia's feet and the pass was not difficult.

2041~~~
Van Gaal: <i>We gave it away [for second goal] but man doing it [Valencia] was <b>best man on my team</b>. Also for him so disappointing.</i>

So Van Gaal thought he was the best man on his team? What match were all the footballing geniuses watching?

2042~~~
This. Him starting is fully deserved. We woulda been ran over a lot more often if it wasn't for Tony. Imagine the current United with Nani and Rafael occupying the right flank, we would been crushed so badly.

2043~~~
We'd probably score 10-15 goals more per season though

2044~~~
To be fair if those mistakes didn't happen and the rest of his game was the same, then I'd say he was a bit of a beast in that game. Sanchez was pretty awful all game and Valencia constantly took the ball off of him and got forward well. Its just when you are the direct reason for 2 goals then there's not much you can say. Think of it this way... I'd say he had a 3 or 4/10 performance. -2 for each goal that he was directly responsible for. Without it he probably would've been up there with de Gea as MotM as his general play was good but you can't have a good game but cost your team 2 goals.

2045~~~
Haha, so great if this is genuine. Got link? Expecting a meltdown on this thread.

2046~~~
Not at all. Rafael is much better positionally then Valencia, and nani probably works harder defensively then di maria does, though its similar.

2047~~~
Yeah, on FIFA15.

2048~~~
For the geniuses:<a class="externalLink" href="http://thepeoplesperson.com/2015/03/10/louis-van-gaal-antonio-valencia-manchester-uniteds-best-player-arsenal-81057/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thepeoplesperson.com/2015/03...manchester-uniteds-best-player-arsenal-81057/</a>

2049~~~
Might be, Raf is a defender after all but the current shaky United will do better without those two to be honest.

2050~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2051~~~
Exactly this  he's made 2 big errors in about 5 months of football (all unfortunately in the same game) and nw ppl are saying he's rubbish. Evans made more errors vs MK Dons. Smalling had a similar costly brainfart vs City. I thappens. It happens even more hen the player is not a natural defender. And you can bet if that was Rafael at RB , Antonio would have been covering the run of the opposing fullback.

2052~~~
And I presume you agree that Newcastle last week was our best performance of the season too?

2053~~~
He's one me over again with some good performances of late as a right back. Last nights performance wont change that. I can't remember him being at fault for a goal this season prior to last nights game. His passing has been more incisive and confident of late, hopefully this won't make him crawl back into his shell. His pass for Di Maria over the defence in the first half was a peach.

2054~~~
Really feel for him, it's sad because he is trying his best but... :/

2055~~~
Maybe Rafael was the 'woman'. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

He's shaved his beard after all.

2056~~~
And I presume you have better insight, better nous, more information, more experience than Van Gaal. Oooh, look at you.

2057~~~
Oh look <a class="username" data-user="20801, @Hectic" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/20801/">@Hectic</a> , Nobby's here.

2058~~~
The current united that is crying out for more creativity but sticks with mostly hard workers with little skill, is partly why we are in this mess.

2059~~~
NANI!!!!!

Nani Nani Nani!!!

2060~~~
LVG's hardly going to come out and slate his player publicly, is he? Even if you disagree that his performance was poor last night, I'd find it incredibly hard to argue that he was our best player.

And besides, if we're all going to just agree with everything the manager says, what's the point of having discussion?

2061~~~
Jones didn't do him any favours with that header, that's for sure.

Was he man marking Sanchez? If so, those instructions caused some havoc that allowed Arsenal's first goal.

2062~~~
He actually did
He actually did slate him publicly for giving away the goal. Did you miss that? I did think he was up there as one of are best players, except obviously for a couple of blips. I´m sorry I agree with Van Gaal.

2063~~~
Fair enough, your opinion, although I thought it was his poorest game in quite a while. Granted, Di Maria often giving the ball away in front of him didn't help admittedly, but his positioning was often very poor. I remember casually strolling around midfield at one point, completely out of position. I also felt he was often pushing too high up the field sometimes, especially when Di Maria would often be unreliable on the ball. He offers a threat in an attacking sense as a full back to an extent, but I feel that Rafael's much more solid defensively...since he is actually a right-back. Valencia's done well to fill in there over the past few months, but he struggled last night I thought.

And simply agreeing with the manager does not necessarily make your opinion correct. LVG's may be a hugely talented manager, but this place would be fairly boring if people who automatically agree with him were perceived as being correct all the time. Like the poster above highlighted in regards to his comments re the Newcastle win and how it was supposedly our best performance of the season.

2064~~~
Yeah, fair enough differing opinions. It does feel good however when you find out a manager's view of Van Gaal´s stature is pretty much spot on with yours. I certainly put more faith in it then a donkey load of often biased angry anonymous posters after a difficult defeat.

2065~~~
So no manager had ever lied in an interview now? I'm sure I remember some Scottish guy we used to have doing it once or twice.

2066~~~
That part is true at least.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2067~~~
Who was it? Was it Darren Fletcher, the bastard!

2068~~~
Either him or his dad

2069~~~
Steven Fletcher? I knew he was older than he says he is.

2070~~~
The backwards pass for the winning goal was a result of the philsophy of less risk posession play. Playing the back pass was less riskier than trying to pass it forwards. It was just that he under hit it and Welbeck is stupidly fast (eg Girioud wouldnt have got there). Also because he has no left foot and thus is limited in what is actually available to him in terms of passing to his players.

The first goal was a case of him being a RW playing at RB.

2071~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Respect for Valencia. He will surely bounce back from this.

2072~~~
Well I certainly don´t think he was lying, especially about the part of slating Valencia for causing the goal. Why would I think he was if I´m in total agreement with him. Maybe we´re both lying to ourselves.

2073~~~
Yeah, my first instinct was that de Gea should have taken him out - but obviously the league is much more important so it was a good job he didn't.

2074~~~
People calling him one of our best players last night need a word with themselves. He cost us 2 goals so regardless of how well he played for the rest of the game you cannot say he had a good game.

I'm not actually that annoyed at him for the 2nd goal, those things happen in football (see Gerrard's previous) and he wasn't helped by Jones at all. Its the first one that is more annoying because he just showed his naivety as a defender and was too focused on the ball rather than being in the position he's supposed to be in.

I don't blame him particularly, I blame the management more than anything. Playing him up against Sanchez is just poor management IMO. Those saying he kept Sanchez quiet need to rewatch the game. Yes he possessed him a couple of times but most of the time Sanchez was twisting & turning past him and Valencia just couldn't get near him. 2 goals came down him side and if it wasn't for world class goalkeeping from De Gea we would have been looking at another 2 coming from his side.

If Rafael really has been dropped for Valencia/McNair based on form and not injury then its probably Van Gaal's worst decision in the management of the squad/starting 11 IMO, up there with playing Rooney in midfield to accommodate Falcao - which arguably cost us about 9 points over the Christmas period. 

I would like to see Valencia retain his place in the 11 but ahead of Rafael.

2075~~~
When Jones chests the ball down to Valencia, surely, Jones would be aware of the fact that Valencia would, in turn, pass it back to De Gea, who would, most likely, have kicked it out anyway. Jones could have saved all that trouble, and waste of precious seconds, by heading the ball out. However, given that Jones seems to have very little footballing intelligence, I'm not sure what he was thinking about whilst chesting the ball.

2076~~~
Yes but you're twisting things a bit. Every counter-attack against us is heart attack material and no creativity on planet earth will help that. Playing Valencia will, and he's been good going forward as well.
If you're talking about not playing Mata I think it's the right decision to not pick him. I rate him yes but he's not the one to play, not with the current options.

2077~~~
TBH Apart from the backpass I can never understand the need to pass it back to DDG so much, and the fact LvG called his own team out on it a few matches back is a bit worrying. David is (nowadays) rarely accurate with his kicks  (when he came he was much better). I agree  what is the point of sending ti back for him to punt it, whn you can punt it yourself with similar results?

2078~~~
Him and Di Maria need to work together instead of two individuals. They'd make each others job much much easier. Considering they are both spanish speakers it shouldn't be difficult to communicate with each other. Di maria is always attracting attention and Valencia needs to be quick to spot the space created and attack it. We'd disorganise so many defences with that sort of play but somehow it seems neither is all that interested in making each others job easier. 
So much cover work goes into making a great team that its absolutely awful how little our players seem to understand the game.

2079~~~
Just saw his apology. Feel for him there, no need to apologise, it was a mistake on a football field.

2080~~~
Answer to your questions.

a) To pass it back to De Gea.
b) Only 1, pass it back to De Gea.

The back pass was an easy one and Valencia fecked it up.

Seeing the video you posted, its a disgrace how Jones didnt bother chasing back till Dea was actually beaten. Could have cut it out had he not just left it to De Gea.

2081~~~
Outside of the two goals i thought he was one of our best players too. Not that it matters them two feck ups were too costly to call it a good performance.
Hope it doesn't send him back into his shell because hes looked vaguely confident and dangerous going forward in recent weeks.

2082~~~
I thought barring the back pass he was quite excellent and I love that he's adapted so well to this new role.

2083~~~
Incidentally i did notice him wandering around midfield at one point and wondered what the feck he was doing.
Was he following sanchez or something?
That was weird

2084~~~
When does Valencia go from a RW being played out of position to an actual RB? He has played all of this season at RB/RWB and has played 15-20 times at RB before this season. For me he is now considered as much a RB as he is a RW, in fact he is probably better at RB than at RW. The problem is he just isn't very good at either positions.

2085~~~
Counting tackles instead of how many times he let the opponent get past him or was one of the main culprits when we conceeded a goal.

We have several posters here who do the same thing. Making 8 tackles is very nice, but doesn't make up for being the weak link and costing your team goals. The 8 tackles pad your good performance, they arent what decides whether it was a good performance and certainly not on a day when said player is constantly exposed by opponents going past him, or is completely out of position

2086~~~
This was the alarming thing for me, he was constantly out of position. I saw him a few times at CM, whats he doing there?

2087~~~
Sometimes he was sticking with his man who got on the ball and went towards the other flank, but at some point you need to pass him on to a teammate and get back into your actual position. If you watch the video of the first goal I posted shortly after the match, the video starts off with Valencia at the top of the screen coming back from the left wing... Slowly. Most likely he's followed his man all that way and he doesnt get back in time so Smalling goes out to confront Ozil.

Rafael is a player who often stays with his man after that player passes the ball, but he doesnt take the piss like following him on to the other side of the pitch

2088~~~
Nah, you're wrong. He's returning from the centre of the pitch. Not the left wing. He had followed Sanchez there (who was in possession at the time) then got back into position after the ball was moved on.

2089~~~
He was clearly told to stick to Sanchez so I think it's harsh to blame him for the first goal, it's a team game and Di Maria should have spotted the danger and filled in.

2090~~~
Sanchez was very clever in the build up to their 1st goal. He dragged Valencia into the centre of the pitch where he could have no influence at all. The second goal was very silly though. He looked to be leaning back and hit the top of the ball when trying the backpass. Strangely enough had a good game apart from those brain farts.

2091~~~
He's not.

2092~~~
This is the main problem with him,he isn't a very good footballer.

He was a good athlete, which seemed to be what most people praised him for, now his pace has all but upped and left you are left with a player who is extremely limited in his ability on the ball and for the most part not very good off it either.

2093~~~
That's bollox. His first touch is as good as any other player on the team. Touch is a great way to judge technique.

2094~~~
I don't know about some of you, but Valencia had a very poor match at right back against Arsenal. He was being dragged all over the place by Sanchez, and he was very poor at maintaining his position and marking players. He was overly reliant on his speed and strength against Sanchez and whoever else he faced, but that over-reliance caused several problems for us as a defensive unit. He was a big culprit in both of our goals, and he struggled, overall, against Sanchez, and we could have conceded more if Arsenal weren't so hesitant when going forward against us in the second half.

This is where a proper full back would have been more useful as he would have been better at marking players and being more positionally aware.

2095~~~
I wouldn't say that he's that limited. His touches and passing are quite good, and he's very composed on the ball. He's quite good at maintaining possession and passing the ball around, but his main weaknesses are that he's a poor dribbler and a slightly-below-average crosser of the ball. It's clear that he's not really cut out to play as part of a back 4 against good sides, but his energy, pace, and discipline are useful against more limited opposition.

2096~~~
He doesn't get injured every other game like .... I don't know...Rafael!!!

2097~~~
I do agree he should not have followed a player so far away from his position. However, it had happened, and with Valencia in Smalling's space - Smalling should have covered his position. 

Blame should be apportioned equally.

2098~~~
He did cover his position, which unfortunately turned out to be the greater of the evils. If you give Ozil time and space because Valencia is walking back to right back and nobody is near him, he might have hurt us but he might not have. We'd probably have got away with it if Smalling ignored Valencia's mistake.

However Valencia charges out and takes himself out of the game with a feeble tackle, so Smalling has to go back to CB duty.

Di Maria should have been tracking his fullback anyway

2099~~~
I was just thinking this the other day. For all of Valencia's annoying traits (one-footedness, indecisiveness, poor crossing, etc.) he does have a silky first touch. Not quite Berbatov or Mata, but impressive nonetheless. That being said, we really could do with an upgrade at RB.

2100~~~
I've got a great first touch, I can pull a ball out of the air on either foot, on my chest, standing or on the run.
Can get a ball under no matter how hard it's fired at me.

I am not a very good footballer though, hence why I run a parcel delivery depot.

If Valencia was a good footballer, I kind of guess he would be really good at football, which he isn't.

2101~~~
If your touch was as good as you say it is but you're still no good at football you're either a fat feck who can't run for shit, incapable of kicking a ball straight or an utter coward. Or all three. Valencia is none of these things, hence is actually really good at football. What with playing for Manchester United and being a consistent starter under three different managers, including the best manager in the history of the game. 

But otherwise yeah, excellent point. I hadn't considered that possibility.

2102~~~
Fair play to him for coming out and admitting to his mistake. I respect him a lot more after that.

2103~~~
Yep agree with Valencia but Jones made yet another idiotic decision by trying to play when it wasn't on.

2104~~~
Plenty of blame to go around to be fair.
I think its fair to assume he was chasing sanchez around under instructions. 
Hes probably spent more time away from the right wing in that one game than he has in his previous hundred or so playing for us.

I'd give him a bit of grief for his tackle for the first goal (which was crap) but smalling and / or di maria were at fault for letting monreal go imo.

2105~~~
Why is a one dimensional largely ineffective winger our new right full?  Conservatism.  LVG not what I expected.

2106~~~
Really?

I'd respect him more if I saw him make a pass with his left foot.

2107~~~
Yet his brain farts cost us dearly. He really needs to sort out his positioning in case he wants to stay our RB

2108~~~
Can someone really have a good game "aside from those mistakes." I mean, I get what people are saying but c'mon. Anyone can have a good game if you completely disregard their errors.

2109~~~
Thiago Silva was a fault last night for the penalty but had a brilliant game. Van Gaal said Valencia was our best player on the night, which I probably agree with.

2110~~~
I agree with you. What it only goes to show is how poor the rest of them were if a guy who's errors cost us the game is singled out as our best player on the night by the manager.

Damning.

2111~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2112~~~
When someone has a poor game, it's usually based on more than one or two errors. They'll generally get something wrong almost every time they touch the ball. You can definitely judge a performance in isolation from one really bad error. And he only made one really bad error. You'd have to be completely clueless to make him the main cuplrit in the first goal.

2113~~~
It's ironic really, because Valencia's greatest attribute is to pass the ball backwards rather than forwards. 

That makes his error all the more unforgivable really doesn't it?

2114~~~
Yeah really, footballers are very egotistical people so for him to come out and apologise for his error is very surprising.

2115~~~
Get the feck out.

2116~~~
Why? It's true, I've worked at football clubs in the past so I've seen it first hand. Or do you just not like the fact I've called your heroes egotistical?

2117~~~
Less than 1 year ago, this article was written.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.footballgate.com/2014/06/18/the-10-fastest-players-in-the-world-according-to-fifa/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.footballgate.com/2014/06/18/the-10-fastest-players-in-the-world-according-to-fifa/</a>
According to that he was one of the fastest players on the planet.
I dont think he has lost his pace and is still one of the fastest players in the league.

2118~~~
My heroes? You mistake me for someone else. Someone about 30 years younger.

Frankly, that you have more respect for a guy who admitted to a mistake because he admitted to the mistake says so much about the world today, or, my age - take your pick.

2119~~~
How people can say he's lost pace despite seeing him run up and down our right flank as both a wingback and rightback all this season, just solidifies my opinion that half the people who post on forums don't watch games and just state blanket recycled opinions for some secret windup pleasure.

2120~~~
According to those kind of articles Phil Jagielka is an Olympic standard sprinter.

The only evidence you need is your eyes and observing how he is unable to get past most left backs in the league.

This is just going to be one of those things where some people are not going to realise just what we are missing until we put someone else in his position.

2121~~~
I just don't see how people are saying he had a good game. He was constantly out of position - it was obvious for the goal, but he was getting dragged around by Sanchez a lot. Maybe he was under instructions? I don't think so.

1. I've seen him being dragged out in many games other than this, every time a diagonal is switched to his flank, he is always scrambling back to defend. 

2. And he was also leaving his spot in the backline to contest many many headers, not just against Sanchez, and not just winnable ones. He lost a few of those and was out of position. So it couldn't have been instructions (He could not have been asked to simultaneously mark Sanchez and also contest every single header in his very general region)

I have never seen him, in any single game, demonstrate that he understands the concept of a backline, how spaces must be filled, how he has to position himself with respect to other players, etc. He plays very reactively to the opposition, gets caught out by almost any runs beyond him, and always needs his pace to get back into position and his power to try and muscle his opponent of the ball. His one-footedness and lack of confidence means it is impossible to play out from the back on his side unless there is a literal straight line of space open in front of him which he can run into and then pause (and then repeat the process). Offensively he is quite impotent. I don't get it, what Moyes and LVG see in him at RB.

2122~~~
So I watched the first goal against Arsenal, at the beginning Valencia is pressing his player, Alexis Sanchez, he do not commit himself to much which is good, and Smalling covers him.
Since Smalling covers him and Arsenal are still on the ball, Valencia takes Smalling's place, and it is Smalling(and Di Maria) who ignores Monreal not Valencia.

2123~~~
Wouldn't Monreal be di Maria's man?

2124~~~
We zonal mark so it's subjective to  other players positioning.

2125~~~
People can talk about who should have been where all day, my issue was his attempt at winning the ball, completely turned his back.

2126~~~
Smalling actually does a good job of tracking his overlap but then he just fecks off centrally. There were a few players on that play who made unbelievable mistakes.

2127~~~
Yep, which is where the problem came from. If di Maria tracked him like any decent winger should, he wouldn't have had such an easy chance. That's the risk of him on the wing!

2128~~~
Everyone wants a new RB and are jumping on Smalling and Jones balls today, but Valencia had another good solid outing down the right and added to his consistency this season.

2129~~~
I thought he was average. Especially looking at Blind on the other side, who backed up play much better. Solid, but a couple of times he got too rash in his tackles and his man ended up goalside (but good covering in general).

2130~~~
He was okay today, but had the benefit of not being put under a lot of pressure like he sometimes was in the Arsenal game.

2131~~~
I don't mind him as RB. I think he's really sharpened up the defensive side of his game compared to last season. 

Can be frustrating in terms of final ball and brainfarts like the Arsenal one will linger.

2132~~~
Played very well today,he is having a very good season for us

2133~~~
No complaints here. I still prefer Rafael, but if Valencia continues playing like he did today, it'll be hard to take him out.

2134~~~
He was ok today but he's still too much of a coward. Sooner we replace him, the better. Too much settling going on.

Like Shaw, he doesn't get forward enough but unlike him, he's not a youngster with a lot to learn and has actually played most of his career on the wing.

2135~~~
It was a good response to the Arsenal game.

Shut down his flank, didn't give the ball away and helped keep our momentum.

2136~~~
Fair play to Antonio he played well enough today after a nightmare performance against Arsenal could have easily went into his shell and played it safe but he tried to provide an outlet down the right and get up the pitch to overlap Mata. Did well enough defensively also.

Got some harsh criticism on Monday from plenty on here (myself included) but felt sorry for him after posting that apology for his mistake.

Still no where near good enough to be a first choice RB for a team with United's ambitions, but he can do a job and he seems like a really nice guy so could still be a useful squad player for us next season..

2137~~~
Did ok i thought, nothing special.

2138~~~
his performances are just about passable from a defensive stand-point, and definitely no contribution attacking-wise worthy of an United right-back, criminal that we keep playing him

2139~~~
He's a squad player getting too many games.

2140~~~
Pretty much sums it up perfect

2141~~~
I find it funny that people are having a go at Valencia after today's game, when I thought he bounced back admirably from the Arsenal horror show. I'm not necessarily convinced he's the long-term answer, but I felt he made a good case for himself today.

2142~~~
Still leading our defenders in assists (5) - good recovery after the last cup game. Linked up well with Mata & ander. We'll need his power & pace vs liverpool. I remember a run from him being the difference a couple years ago when we won with a penalty.

2143~~~
He made a backpass and showed he can do it properly <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

His lack of using his left foot limits what he can do in certain positions though (and sometimes kills an easy one-two on that wing). Saying that, he did well, again as to be expected. hes consistent without being spectacular but will see how he does in the games coming up. Still think we need a RB (or to play Rafael)

2144~~~
Thought he did well, I'm glad that van Gaal didn't drop him for Rafael. Staying in the team and playing well against the Spurs will do his confidence a lot of good.

He's is solid option I like to have him in the team but there are some situations where you can't help yourself on that right hand side and hit the wall with your head for what he does or doesn't. He plays like robot, pre programmed to do what is asked and is really very predictable in what he does. Rafael would have threaded through some balls to Mata/Herrera, he's much more creative. I'd like to see him back at RB..

2146~~~
Solid per normal and per normal frustrating. One time he was up against Eriksen one on one and just didn't take him on. Should be taking his lunch (and dinner). Just wish he'd turn that switch on where he knows no one can keep up with him if he tries.

2147~~~
It's weird that he doesn't just kick and run more as he blasted past Eriksen on a defensive run and stole the ball from him. 

I think Valencia can come in handy against Liverpool as he is one of the few players that arguably have more pace than Sterling. He's normally pretty good against them as well.

2148~~~
Standard performance from him did nothing bad, but also nothing good.

2149~~~
Sometimes I think I'm watching a different player to others when it comes to Valencia

Seemed to me he had a solid 1st half but was unspectacular in attack. 

Loads seem to think he was awful.

2150~~~
Looked a little shaky defending but has been solid as usual. Not sure where his crossing has gone. He just doesn't even want to cross the ball anymore.

2151~~~
It doesn't matter how he plays to some. It's easier for Blind on the other side as he has Ashley Young ahead of him. Mata is a good player but you wouldn't want him ahead of you if you were a full back.

2152~~~
He was an obvious weak link to me. Not because he made any particular mistakes but he simply lacks quality and vision on the ball. Herrera and Mata are playing lovely intricate stuff on that side, and Valencia seems like such an odd one out.

I think it is infuriating because we have Rafael who hasn't been given a chance by LVG, who I reckon could form a brilliant partnership/trioship with Mata/Herrera on that side.

2153~~~
He's absolutely atrocious. 

Yes he goes in hard in the tackle, but positionally he gets caught out about twice a half and on the ball he's ridiculously suspect. 

The less said about him going forward the better, he's quite possibly the worst right back in the league.

2154~~~
He was good under the circumstances but he scares the life out of me. You expect him to make a mistake with all the hesitancy in his game.

2155~~~
Go and watch a few games of football. You're in dire need of it.

2156~~~
I thought he did well to link with Mata and Ander, he always made himself available for the short pass. Defensively he has been dragged out a few times because Moreno is so deep and he has lost Sturridge in behind. Simply just doesn't have the awareness imo.

2157~~~
If you really think the performances he's given us are good enough, and that he wasn't a complete bomb scare in a game we were dominating then I give up, really.

2158~~~
Will be interesting to see if we bring in a right back over the summer. I still think Valencia should be played on the wing rather than at fullback.

2159~~~
Shocking first half but improved in the 2nd. Personally would have hooked him for Rafael at half time. Nonetheless, we've had plenty of players put in worse performances this year.

2160~~~
How the feck has he been awful? Was a tank today, brilliant at holding on to the ball and finding a man with a pass always.

2161~~~
He was good today... really strong on the ball, and used it smartly, and didn't really let anything get in behind him.

He's just an easy target unfortunately

2162~~~
If you think he's the worst right back in the League then I agree that giving up would be best all round. He's a better right back than the team we were playing today have just to start off.

2163~~~
I thought he had a decent first half and was a key player in eating up the clock with his strength on the ball and experience in the second half.

2164~~~
Absolutely solid today,most be one of our players of the season

2165~~~
The centre backs lost Sturridge. He was their man after all.

2166~~~
Almost no player gives the ball away less than Valencia does, yet you think he is suspect on the ball. That is a ridiculous statement, tbh. He may not be inventive, but he is very technically sound.

2167~~~
His consistent 7/10 Solid performance.   It is easy to see why LvG prefers him to the roller coaster of Rafael

2168~~~
Yes, Smalling was awful on one of the chances too, didn't have a clue where Sturridge was and then chased with Valencia opening up the gap for Lallana. Sturridge isn't simply their man though, if he drifts wide as he did then you pass him onto the fullback.

2169~~~
Which is fair enough if he's in a position to cover which he wasn't. You also have to make him aware you've passed him on which we'll never know.

2170~~~
Along with Rooney, our poorest performer. I was bricking it every time the ball came near him. Surely Rafa deserves a run, can't do any worse.

2171~~~
He wasn't in a position to cover because he is oblivious to his surroundings, its not like he was actually doing anything. Yes, we don't know what the communication was like so I can't comment on it, if there was none then Smalling obviously has to do better.

2172~~~
Needs to take responsibility himself when the ball's played to him and we need to release some pressure. Needs to take on a man instead of always looking for someone.

2173~~~
He was up the pitch because Rooney lost the ball in an advanced position if I remember it right. We expect him to get forward so the centre backs need to be handling a lone centre forward better.

2174~~~
I don't disagree with the people attacking those going after Valencia with completely unfair criticism such as him losing the ball a lot, however, just like against Arsenal, his positioning was poor first half.

2175~~~
Given he's relatively new to the position we can't be that surprised and his pace and strength normally make up for it. He's getting better in that respect. Some here just want their darling in the team and will see what they want to see.

2176~~~
Thought he was solid enough today. I think people are expecting a wingers performance from him at times which is unfair. Mata isn't a winger who will go on the outside therefore Valencia is expected to contribute most of that, but he also has to be aware defensively but I feel he's getting better in that position, and he's definitely not a liability. However, I would still rather see Rafael there.

2177~~~
Defensively bossed that side. Players rarely beat him and showed good combination play with Herrera and Mata.

2178~~~
One thing ive noticed is when he goes forward on the right, Rooney should be making a run to give him an option. As he doesnt do that, Valencia has to cut back in which limits what he can do (especially give how right footed he is). This happened a few times in the first half and Neville even mentioned it. Hes basically become an old school RB in terms of being strong defensively but could use improving going forward.

2179~~~
I don't understand the criticism. Thought he did pretty well and I really liked his partnership with Mata and Herrera on the right. Our two most frequent pass combinations were Valencia to Mata (35) and Mata to Valencia (23) with Herrera to Valencia (17) on fourth place.

I feel like some of you still think of him as a winger. Yes, he didn't bring much danger in the final third, didn't beat a man very often and his passes were mostly safe, sideways or backwards. However, you've got to remember that he's a defender now, playing against Liverpool at Anfield, a team that relies on very quick transition and counters. He couldn't afford to be too adventurous.

I prefer him at RB nowadays. The chances of him ending up on the wing in the final third and smashing the ball at the opponent's full back are significantly reduced that way and I'm grateful for that.

2180~~~
I thought he was decent. Not an easy game and going forward, he, Mata and Herrera are brilliant

2181~~~
Another top performance. Can't really see much of a need to buy another RB if we are keeping both TonyV and Rafa next year. If they can integrate into LvG's system then we're not likely to get much of an improvement from an outside player.

2182~~~
Him, Mata and Herrera link up brilliantly on the right. Same with Blind, Fellaini and Young on the flank. Critical to our play in the last 2 games.

2183~~~
Needs to put a range of quality before some stop the unfair criticism they give him ( a la Smalling, Fellaini). Valencia was fine today.

2184~~~
Defensively we look fragile as hell. Liverpool created a few good chances despite barely having the ball, yet everyone goes on about how good our defenders did.

2185~~~
Most underwhelming performances from an United player, the whole season. We would have been in a much better position if we had played Rafael instead (for example we would still have been in the FA Cup)

2186~~~
When? De Gea never made a save. They'd one chance before their goal.

2187~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Jaysus, the drivel spouted in this thread.

Mind you, I would agree that yesterday was arguably Valencia's worst performance this season. I think Van Gaal was spot on not to drop him after that one bad mistake against Arsenal because his overall performance was good in that game. As he has been in most games this season. Against Liverpool, though, he didn't play well at all. I wonder if that might have opened the door for Rafael.

2188~~~
Baffling post. Liverpool created feck all.

2189~~~
you are just being contrary for the sake of it. how is are Valencia's performances not underwhelming for a right-back? He barely does the job defensively and he clogs up the play offensively while making no meaningful contribution

2190~~~
Some of you are so delusional because of your love for Rafa. Time to wake up and let it go, Valencia was decent enough yesterday. He isnt there to create and cross the ball all the time. He plays reliable and consistent most of the time, which is probably what LvG asks. Liverpool created 2 chances, suddenly they were world beaters yesterday and Valencia was at fault for everything. 

Sell Rafa, buy a new RB and keep Valencia in the squad. Thats what will happen, if you like it or not.

2191~~~
More drivel.

Seriously, I think we've been watching different games so I don't know where to begin with a response. All I can say is you need to pay more attention.

2192~~~
He's a beast of a right back. People need to be more objective and forget their petty opinions of various players. 

I completely wrote off both Valencia and Fellaini last season and argued til I was blue in the face that they had no future here and we're completely useless. 

Well guess what? I was completely wrong. Both players have been excellent this season. Humble pie, learn to eat it some times.

2193~~~
Solid performance yesterday, was surprised to see how well he managed to keep possession under pressure.

2194~~~
As solid as a player can get. One of his best attributes is his ability to use his strength and pace to get out of tight situations. It's as clear as daylight that he's been instructed not to commit forward too much, and allow the likes of Mata and Herrera to be more creative.

2195~~~
i could say the same thing for every thing you post in case we don't agree.

our expectations of what is required from a full-back seem to be very different.

2196~~~
I feel like some people still think of him as what we bought to replace Ronaldo and their butts still hurt.

2197~~~
Yep. Pressure him all you want; he's got this great ability to swivel, turn and fake his way out of a tight spot despite only using one foot.

I think the main reason behind his improvement is he isn't being asked to take on his full back at every single opportunity and cross the ball.

2198~~~
He's fine as a back up player. He's versatility and willing to give 100% whenever called upon, even if that means not playing every week. You need people like that in your squad. If he plays every week at right back then eventually we're gonna see mistakes from him that cost us, the one against Arsenal being a prime example. Further forward he can still be effective, just not often enough to be playing there week in week out anymore, unfortunately Hopefully we bring in a new right back and winger next season so he can be used more sparingly. Don't see any point in selling him, we'd not get that much and he's a good player.

2199~~~
You just have to assume he will be caught out of position at least 2-3 times a game and ignore it. Since he was solid otherwise, I gave him a 7/10. I don't expect him to ever learn positioning, and successive managers seem to be ok with that, so I've got to revise my standards downwards too.

2200~~~
I think he has improved under LVG.  Most likely the summer will see Rafael sold and a proven RB brought in with Valencia becoming a capable squad player.

2201~~~
He had several shaky moments and got caught out of position. Other than that, he did a decent job and was instructed not to be too attacking minded

2202~~~
Valencia understands his role and was disciplined, staying deeper and allowing Mata and Herrera to do their creative thing. It also helps that he and Smalling usually have the speed and strength to bale out the right side of defence when someone gets it wrong.
Don't see the point of bringing in Rafael for squeaky bum time. He can't be anywhere near match fit.

2203~~~
Against Liverpool, Valencia did struggle quite a bit with Sturridge's movement. He was often unsure about whether to follow Sturridge around, stay inside, or stay outside. However, given that Coutinho and Moreno barely got a sniff on their left side thanks to our midfield and Mata doing a great job of shutting them down, the supply to Sturridge was pretty much shut off, particularly when they went down to 10 men. Thus, Valencia didn't have as much trouble against Sturridge as he did against Sanchez, for example.

On the ball, though, he was very reliable and calm. For someone so right-footed, he really is excellent at keeping the ball, controlling it, maintaining possession, and passing it into space. I was also very happy with how disciplined he was, overall. His reliability on the ball is a big reason as to why he starts regularly.

I still don't think he can be a regular right back as he will be exposed against good-quality teams, but he's quite a reliable option to have for many matches.

2204~~~
Unless we have absolutely World class top drawer players in every position which of course is possible with luck and insane spending, I think Valencia has proven to be an excellent prospect at Right Back.

Yes, his defensive awareness may be suspect and you'd expect him to make 1-2 mistakes per game but the truth is almost all players make mistakes every game and that's why we have a team to cover up. He is disciplined, technically very sound if not fanciful, strong, pacey, does what he is told, able to get out of tight spots and able to put in an offensive shift. I think his defensive awareness can be improved and if anyone can do that it is LVG.

2205~~~
I don't get it. He doesn't provide anything going forward (infact you know the attack is dead when he's gets on the ball) and he's defensively suspect, his positioning is all over the place and he seems to panic when he's put under pressure, why is the man getting is much plaudits here? Rafael has his weaknesses (that of an atypical full back) but he also has strengths that far surpass that of Valencia.

2206~~~
I'm all for Valencia to carry on at right back. May not be a world class one, but he's effective and consistent. Seems to be working well on that right side with Mata and Herrera.

2207~~~
Fits into LvG gameplan of possession football.  Always available for the ball on the right side.  Looking at the way we played in the last two games, he seemed comfortable to let Herrera and Mata do all the work while providing options for them to play the one-two layoff.

2208~~~
still needs to work on his positioning to be considered a full-back. Taking on players has been improved a little recently but must use his pace more regular to beat defenders.

I consider him a valuable squad player and wouldn't sell him but I prefer Rafael as RB. Rafa's injury record means Tony will still play a lot.

2209~~~
Even though he hasn't had the same spectacular improvement as Young has had under Van Gaal, i am really pleased with Valencia this season. He still might be the most one footed player in the world, but has been very solid at RB this season.

2210~~~
Although i sort of agree on your other points especially him not providing much going forward, i have to disagree with that bolded part.

He's actually really good in possession these days and rarely ever loses the ball, its probably why Van Gaal likes him so much. Granted he doesn't do anything spectacular with the ball when he gets it, he usually just plays it short back or inside. 

But for all his limitations as a player these days i think we should give him credit for the things he does well, and keeping possession is probably his biggest strength.

2211~~~
Having a good season, his last few games he has been solid. I think the high pressing tactics and having players more creative in front of him have helped him make this position his own. Not to mention he's rarely injured.

2212~~~
But that's just it, a massive problem for us this season is possession for the sake of possession correct? Valencia does nothing with it and reverts to a short backwards/sideways pass almost every time he gets it. The team will be moving the ball and themselves to create a space and as soon as it goes to Valencia he takes his standard 17 touches, dwells on the ball and knocks it 4 yards, killing all prior work to create space for a chance.

2213~~~
Well yeah i'll be honest i haven't been as impressed with Valencia at RB this season as some seem to be, and when we were playing badly as a team he frustrated me with his attacking play.

But none of that changes the fact he is really good at keeping the ball and rarely ever panics and loses it. On sunday his ball retention proved useful when Liverpool were trying to press us, he was a good out ball for Smalling.

2214~~~
I'll give you that but he still isn't what I'd call composed on the ball, he freezes.

2215~~~
He is effective and consistent, rarely injured and links up well with whoever he is with on the right.
I still think we should get Coleman/Danilo as a starting RB next season but Valencia is a great backup for both RW and RB.

2216~~~
Well yeah sometimes he doesn't look that composed but that may be just his style he isn't the most graceful of players, which is probably at least in part down to his complete unwillingness to use his left foot for anything other than standing on.

2217~~~
I always laugh when I see posters saying Valencia is a percentage player who always looks for the safest option as if it was a bad thing. The truth is, those are two of the most important traits any good defender should possess. It's almost like talking footie with a young un who only looks for the compilation material bits of action and adores Kyle Walker because he scored a couple of screamers.

He does tend to be caught out defensively but nowhere near as often as he's made out to be. For example his positional awareness against Liverpool was considerably better than Blind's who's much more of a nominal full-back. My only qualm with his performance was that there were a couple of times where he should have take their defender and get the cross in when the intricate passing between him, Mata and Herrera created the space and cleared the double-marking.

2218~~~
You'd be absolutely right if football was still being played in 1987. A full back is now as responsible (arguably more so) to contribute to attacks as he is at defending.  Its the modern game.

2219~~~
Says who? 

A full back does what his manager asks him to do.

2220~~~
You can contribute to the attack massively while still being a solid full-back in a Gary Neville mould and tbf Valencia doesn't take any credit for his one-twos and keeping possession. He's a good offensive outlet without the final ball but he now has others to do that. If he can improve his crossing, and it has somewhat improved which obviously wasn't hard, he will make a very good full-back.

He's been one of our most consistent performers this season and he has chipped in with 5 assists already and if he can get 2 or 3 till the end of the season it would have to be seen as a decent attacking output for a full-back.

2221~~~
I'm warming to Valencia remaining in his current role. He seems adaptable enough to settle in and become very good at this.

2222~~~
Exactly the point. There is a reason why different United managers tend to play him and are happy with his contribution.

2223~~~
No one in our squad, apart from possibly De Gea, who is a consistent as Valencia. I really wouldn't mind if he was our first choice right back next season.

2224~~~
Agreed. Having him and Rafa (if he stays) would be more than sufficient and would provide a bit of needed continuity.

2225~~~
You must be watching his play with a mindset that's he's an awful player, maybe that's why your insights of him are so way off?

I get that when he gets the ball he might stall a bit too much but saying he doesn't provide nothing going forward is plain wrong. 
He's got plenty of assists this season, going past Moreno (nutmeg!) and pass to Rooney's goal at Old Trafford comes to mind.
Also it's notable that recently as he's got the ball in an attacking position, instead of running into a wall as the opposition floods the right flank, he has started cutting inside or trying a 1-2 pass with the other wide player.

And I think you should reconsider playing Mata or Di Maria with Rafael on the right flank, that'd be squeaky bum time x 2.

Yes, I will buy his shirt from the WBA home game <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2226~~~
This especially for some of the football "experts" on here. I think I'll stickw ith Fergie, Moyes & Van Gaal's judgement (and my own) over theirs!

2227~~~
Model pro, is Valencia.

He's one of those consistent players. You know what you're going to get from him.

The question isn't about his contribution because no one can deny that. The question for me is whether we're happy with someone of his ability to be first choice right back for us? Valencia is never going to be world class at RB, IMO, which is understandable. 

Personally, I'd prefer to have Valencia as a back up RB. But maybe he will be "van-Gaal'd" and prove me wrong by becoming a top RB.

2228~~~
Absolutely. Without any doubt whatsoever.

2229~~~
Say Valencia is a new Van Gaal's full-back signing and has performed the way he has this season, would the general opinion be different on him? I believe it would. The fact that he had those 2 massacres of seasons and is a winger people tend to seek any unfull-back bits of play and even the slightest mistakes that in their eyes prove he's never a good idea to play there. 

Blind (while still having a decent game) showed that cultured full-backs make mistakes as well and he made more positional mistakes against Liverpool than Valencia does in 5 games. Accept that. Times when we had the best players for each positions in the league are gone for the time-being but if you are to replace a couple of those with solid 7/10 players it's not the end of the world.

2230~~~
You can and should do both, Valencia doesn't. He's not a fullback and plays like a player who doesn't know how to play fullback. It appears after the last 2 average performances everyone has entirely forgotten how a fullback should play and how dire he had been all season. When did we start celebrating mediocrity? The fact he doesn't have the capacity to play great passes doesn't mean its a talent that he plays the simple pass, EVERYTIME. We might as well play another CB there and have done with it.

2231~~~
He isn't capable of doing anything other than what he is being asked, theres a big difference.

2232~~~
So what is this stuff about him being poor defensively? If somebody can be help me out with stats, I believe a bare minimum of attacks have come from his side of the pitch. Yes, offensively he'll not contribute as much as Rafael but defensive wise he is much better. Does not dive into rash tackles and haven't seen anybody beat him for speed. And assured in possession (barring the screw up against Arsenal).

2233~~~
He's doing a good job but Rafael is better in every way bar pace and strength and actually Rafael is quicker in shirt bursts. Although Rafael is very short and is targeted for headers at the far post which is a concern even though Rafael is good in the air for a little guy.

The amount if times Valencia links up nicely with his winger is usually 0. That's unacceptable. 

Everything seems rosy now but for most of the season we hardly create anything and I think a big reason is that our fullbacks don't link well with our forwards, don't dribble enough and don't get in any crosses. 

Young has been the best of the lot and Rafael has barely played despite being the most technically gifted fullback at the club by some distance.

It's a real shame about him being injury prone but that's a boring discussion now.

2234~~~
Rafael is an aggressive tackler but actually wins them and you rarely see him get dribbled past and he has shut down some of the world's top wingers.

2235~~~
Doesn't Valencia have good record of winning headers (both offensive and defensive)? His built gives him the added advantage. LvG must have seen something and thus not playing Rafael even while he is fit. If this continues, he may well be sold and United may get into the market for a new RB. 

Oh and also looks like Valencia shall now be played as a RB only and not a winger anymore. His time as a winger may as well be over.

Only for LvG to play him as one in the next game.

2236~~~
If he's fit, I think Rafael-Herrera-Mata would be a terror to deal with on the right. Their passing and movement would be beautiful.

2237~~~
Valencia is great. I really think he is one of our better players this season. He is a tank, fast, can mix it up, improves defensively. I dont see what people are expecting of him. It is unfair to say he offers nothing. He doesnt play as a RW, he is a RB and does his job defensively. Offensively he is always available and keeps posession. With a better defensive line next year and more confidence in the position, i can see him developing even better.

2238~~~
Absolutely agree with this. I don't mind him at RB at all.

2239~~~
I just wish he would learn to cross. He would become a very good right back.

2240~~~
Because of his bloody one footedness. All his markers do is show him on the right and he has to make a 180 turn just to get the ball on his favoured foot. This aspect of his game irritates me the most. There was a shining (not really) example of this during the Liverpool game when he got boxed in and he held it for ages before telling Rooney he should've come for the ball. The time he takes on the ball allows the opposition to reset and cover our other players moving off the ball.

2241~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  Just got a mental image of Rafael as the Hulk.

2242~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> There is no point it discussing it really.

2243~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> clearly.

Its simple, if Blind used the ball in the same manner as Valencia you'd crucify him for it because you know he's capable of more. Just because Valencia can't seem to pass more than 4 yards in a forward direction it doesn't mean doing nothing with the ball is acceptable. It also doesn't mean handing the ball to Welbeck or being woefully out of position and directly giving away 2 goals is acceptable either.

2244~~~
Mate you're fighting a lost cause on here and I do have a bit of sympathy for you because of that. Clearly, though,  if 99% of posters on here, good portion of which were Valencia's ardent critics in the past, have the polar opposite of your opinion then perhaps it's the high time you think it over?

And your argument that he 'doesn't do MORE than Van Gaal asks him to do' is laughable at best. He does what his managers want him to and they're happy with him. More importantly, Van Gaal is happy with him this season which counts for a little bit more than your irrational hatred towards Valencia and is a perfectly fine proof for the fact he's been having a decent season. Unless, of course, you think Van Gaal is a moron which I naively don't think you do.

2245~~~
I have no problems with people saying he's not good enough to be our first choice right-back. I don't quote and argue with anyone claiming that. In a perfect world, we should indeed have a specialized right-back who's better than Valencia and we did have those in the past. As things stand, however, he does his job and doesn't stand out as the poorer player in our current set up and has been decent this season.

2246~~~
For the people who claim he's not good enough to be our first choice RB what are the realistic alternatives? Apart from a poor backpass vs Arsenal he's very solid defensively, rarely ever loses the ball, provides width and is probably the best 1v1 FB in the league, can't remember anyone getting the better of him. His delivery is still pretty poor for the most part but I struggle to think of any FB's as good as him defensively who offer more going forward.

2247~~~
Realistically, he is good enough right now. Ideally, we could improve on that if some cultured, high-profile AND proven right-back emerges and is obtainable. As you said, though, there aren't many better right-backs in the league which is a good testament to Valencia who plays out of position.

2248~~~
Valencia is arguably the most improved player in the first team. He runs Ashley Young close, at the very least. I say that because it's easy to forget just how horrific he was as a winger during the two seasons prior. He was putting in some of the worst performances any attacker had done in the entirety of Ferguson's reign. That bad.

His performances levels at right back, right now, are dramatically improved and he's doing an admirable job in a position that is somewhat new.

He's hard to beat, athletic, a constant option out wide and extremely tidy on the ball. His positioning has improved, too. It still needs work going forward, however.

We still need a new right back, and I do consider it to be a hugely necessary purchase, but he's a great option to have in the squad. And seldom injured, which makes him reliable.

Yes flawless logic there, I suppose the earth is flat, searing meat seals the moisture in and microwaves cook food from the inside out. Go back a month and you'll see plenty who don't rate Valencia, he hasnt become a good player in the space of a month.

I don't think someone with your tagline should be calling peoples views on players 'irrational' mate, I suppose the difference between the two of use is that I don't celebrate mediocrity.

Despite the fact you've complete misunderstood my point about LVG the bolded part is my favourite, I suppose you thought 2 months ago playing RVP and Falcao up top together, Rooney in midfield and Herrera on the bench was the answer did you?  Exactly.

You disagree with me fair enough, you don't have to be a moron about it.

2250~~~
I actually think he's been a bit of a beast at RB and his performances last season are still being held against him. There's really not that many better RB's around and i'm happy to see him continue.

2251~~~
If that's your line of defence then it's a bit sad. Anyway, let me explain it to you, man with a perfect tagline. My tagline is the effect of banter with Cina some 2 years ago I think. It stems from the fact that Cina was the biggest fanboi of Nani and I was seen as one of the three biggest Valencia's fan on here. I liked it from the word go even if it was unwarranted - it was funny at the time. Never have I got people against me using the line you did because they saw, at that time, that it bore little truth and I could easily talk to Nani's biggest fans without them pertaining to my tagline. 

We exchanged our opinions on our favourite players and whereas Cina was just as warm towards Nani and cold towards Valencia as me for the reverse, I got the tagline and he didn't (I think and I don't know if he was a mod back then). If you cared to dig that old thread out, you would see quite a few people being dumbfounded as to why I got this tag where the truth was I was hardly over the top with Nani criticism. A few people in fact pointed out to the fact that I was, ironically, Nani's biggest defender when he hit the bad form and was a subject of dog's abuse on here. I constantly stressed that he's good enough to play for us and that I don't want him to go. Even at the beginning of this season I said I don't want him to go to Sporting because he's easily good enough to play here, AT LEAST as a back-up. That would be the exact minimum role that I said Valencia would get and rarely failed to acknowledge that Nani is actually the more talented of the two even if I sometimes lamented his consistency (just as 99% people on here did). Time goes by and I still want him back pretty badly, that's hardly a feature of sb who has irrational hatred towards him, is it?

As for the last bit, no, I didn't think Rooney-Falcao-Van Persie worked which is what, surprise surprise, what LvG himself abandoned! I somehow haven't seen yet Van Gaal benching Valencia for good and have you? We are 8 games from the big day and still field Valencia almost week in week out. I believe that's a tiny little difference, don't you?

2252~~~
Firstly you're just jealous you can't talk to horses and you seriously just wrote all that for a throw away comment? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> you're commit is commendable I'll give you that.

Think we'll agree to disagree.

2253~~~
He's not as fast as you'd expect from a person of Latino ethnicity.

<span style="font-size: 9px"><span style="color: #ffffff">White text.</span></span>

2254~~~
It's called respect mate. You didn't know what you were talking about, henceforth I cared to explain it. It's also great that you don't celebrate mediocrity that basically everyone (apart from you) in the last few pages celebrate. We somehow lowered our standards and it seems a player who's played a part in, and got good reviews for, our three biggest wins this season (Arsenal away, Liverpool home, Liverpool away) and has been consistently our go to full-back in a difficult season is good enough in our view. We need to have a word with ourselves I think. Yes, probably should have stopped at the lols we exchanged earlier then.

2255~~~
Rarely gets beaten in a 1v1, fast, strong, very accurate passer of the ball, so good with his right foot, he never uses his left, and most importantly, is quite intelligent. 

Our defense is a weird one, they're all presumed to be shit, but they're actually not. The fact that he comfortably slots into the right back position illustrates just how good he's been. Don't think we need a new RB, next season.

2256~~~
I just can't agree with that. Being "not necessarily shit" doesn't make someone much improved.

I still maintain that the standards are set so incredibly low on Valencia and Young that any time they don't have an awful performance people are genuinely <i>impressed</i>. That's bonkers. Admittedly Young has played well to some extent, yet he's still only got one goal and one assist. How many does Valencia have? About the same? I can only recall a cross that Valencia smashed, missed everyone and somehow went into the net off a deflection.

These guys are both nearing 30 and should be in the absolute peak of their careers. They both have received ample minutes (has anyone played more than Valencia this year?), and while I know Valencia hasn't played a lot in an attacking position (thus limiting his goal/assist opportunities), he did play RWB for quite a while and really ought to have contributed more than he did.

Is he fine defensively? Sure. But for my money, Rafael can do just as well defensively while adding a shit load more going forward.

2257~~~
Valencia is like your wife:

- Was amazing back in the day.
- Not as exciting as before, but reliable and loyal.
- You want someone younger and with more potential, but that is expensive and risky.

2258~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Is it wrong that the premise has me somewhat aroused?

2259~~~
Where does Rafael fit into this?

2260~~~
I still don't understand why people still say he isn't a natural right back. He's clearly a decent right back and not playing out of position. 

He would probably look more out of position these days as a winger than at right back.

2261~~~
That crazy freak of a feck buddy you mess around with. You can't count on her to always be there - she's a bit of a nomad - but when she's around, you damn well no about it.

2262~~~
Without a doubt I've got a huge soft spot for Rafael and would love to see him playing because of that. Yet, realistically, Valencia has been more than good enough to be playing and keep his spot. I get frustrated by his lack of adventure but, have to think that stems so much from the times he was this unstoppable winger, it's hard to forget that and expect that. If one takes that out of their mind and just judges Valencia against other fullbacks, then he offers as much as most anyone else going forward if not more and at the same time has provided a solid defense down that right side.

Valencia does very often take the percentage pass and that's exactly what he should be doing as the right back. Attacking fullbacks doesn't mean attack every single time and leave your side exposed. This guy picks and chooses his moments and does it quite often. He drives inside often with the ball while providing the width when the Mata's of the side come inside.

In some ways we should be very glad to have him in the team week in and week out even if you don't like his style because one thing United have lacked is a consistent line up and with him at least get one piece that you can count on each week.

2263~~~
You also can't rely on that that slut to play her position right like every good side chick should.

2264~~~
Definitely. She gets far too excited when things get serious. Splashing out when she shouldn't be and such. Every man(ager) wants consistency and reliance in his lady. Just like Ol Tony V.

2265~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2266~~~
Been excellent at right back

2267~~~
And she doesn't mind watching from the bench, when you play the young one.

2268~~~
Sometimes they even play together!  One up front and the other overlapping from behind.

2269~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2270~~~
And at the first sign of trouble she turns her back on you.

2273~~~
Because he has absolutely no awareness of what's behind him. He charges into players infront of him and he gets caught napping whenever someone makes a run in behind. If he'd have played right back for his whole career then maybe it wouldn't be such an issue, but playing their requires some instincts and attributes that Valencia simply doesn't have because he's not been coached to play there until recently. 

He's good on the ball, he can carry it forward well and rarely gets beaten 1v1. He has his strengths, and he's been competent when you consider the circumstances. Would I want to see him as our first choice right back next season? Not for me.

2274~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2275~~~
I literally could have used that first paragraph to describe Rafael. 

I'd be fine for us to get an even better younger right back summer, but it really isn't that much if an issue I think. Most of the right backs out there have some issue,good at defending but bad going fwd, vice versa, bad on the ball, poor first touch all of the above. 

Valencia is a right back, he may not be the best in the world. But he can't be considered a midfielder. It's more laughable to call kyle Walker a right back over turn back Tony these days.

2276~~~
Care to provide some examples? Since Valencia's moved to right back, I can hardly remember a game where we've been troubled on the right side. I thought he handled Sanchez, Eriksen and Moreno fine in the games against Arsenal, Spurs and Liverpool, respectively.

2277~~~
You win. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2278~~~
The ones that spring to mind are the Lallana chance the other day, see Arsenals first goal in the FA cup (for being dragged out of position) see any goal in the last two seasons City have scored from a Kolarov overlap (that was when I first became aware of it, when he was actually playing right wing). All in all, he's done well, let's not draw away from the fact that I'm happy with his performances this season. However, next season I really do think we need to purchase a right back if we're not under the impression that Rafael is a long term option.

2279~~~
Those are all fair points, my issue is that people don't consider him a right back. Which us unfair because although he may not be world class, he's better than 3/4 of the "natural right backs"  in the league this season, and it's his best possition as he's a shit winger.

2280~~~
Who doesn't get a kick out of Valencia using his absurd strength to barge someone off the ball? It's one of life's few joys....

2281~~~
In terms of charging out I'd agree regarding Rafael, I wouldn't so much however with his awareness of what's behind him because he's generally quite good in that regard, his defensive headers at the back post especially.

The thing with Valencia is that the attributes that impress me at full back are those that impressed me at right wing as well. Whether they are more suited to a right back then that's up for debate, but as I say, there's some habits he has from playing right wing that also hinder him on occasions at right back. I know it's probably just as important for the modern day full back to be good on the ball, especially in our system, but I just think at the highest level, which hopefully we'll be at next season regarding the Champions League, that his weaknesses as a right back will be exposed more than they have this season.

2282~~~
Possibly, yeah. I mean the more I think about it the more I'm probably inclined to agree with you, as I'd rather see him in the line up at right back than right wing. It's just despite that, I'd still rather have a different first choice right back long term, for the reasons stated in the other post I just made.

2283~~~
Valencia's pace covers up his lack of awareness and poor positioning.. He's been caught out of position quite a few times but gets back quick enough to prevent a mess up.. Plus it's not easy to win the ball from him because of his strength, so forwards don't usually try to target him either. I think he can make a good squad player who can cover at RB, RWB and RW. He's like Park, you know you'll get a 7/10 performance from him, sometimes even better.

2284~~~
Not really, there were several occasions where he couldnt prevent them from scoring. It is something he really needs to work on

2285~~~
Agreed.

2286~~~
For a FB - someone that can give you 7/10 performances week in and week out is an absolute blessing. That's what he gives us. I used to argue that was what he gave us on the right wing and his peaks would rarely hit 8/9/10 but, he was a player you could count on. So many of our past winning teams have been built on the team having these players that you can just count on - they don't all have to be world class individually but, make the team one to be reckoned with.

If we can get any kind of consistent line up down the right side, Valencia will be that much better. He used to have a great partnership with Rafael because they played enough together to build that understanding. Also, now that we are settling into a system that the players are more comfortable, I expect we'll get more out of the attacking side as well. He is already doing quite a bit in terms of taking the ball infield and trying to drive forward because he knows there is someone there to cover and as LVG said they've got that Spanish wing thing going as well.

Valencia is the least of the worries we have IMO for the next couple seasons.

2287~~~
I have no idea where the Hernandez thread went, but Chicharito just scored a scorching goal at the LA Coliseum v Ecuador a few minutes ago.

Bring the little pea back!

2288~~~
The man is hungry.  Sign him up!

2289~~~
I can think of probably 3 or 4 mistakes he has made there all season and it's easy to use that mistakes against him and show why he isn't a fullback but then how many mistakes have Zabaleta and Ivanovic made this season? I think he is good enough to go into next season as our first choice. I think he will only get better there.

2290~~~
Geez, my posts in this thread are rather embarrassing<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

I just find it so hard to accept the player he has become compared to the kind of player he was. Judging his performances on this season alone he's probably done a very good job at full back and it probably makes a lot more sense to stick with him than sign than sign some shiny new expensive player who's not any better.

2291~~~
I think he's been excellent at right back and will only get better. Much prefer having him and selling Rafael if we are buying in this position. Plus if we sign Clyne I could see Valencia keeping him out the team. I know the majority don't rate him but for me he's been with DDG Rooney and Blind one of our most consistent and reliable players. We have much more pressing positions to fill than Valencia in the short term.

2292~~~
The amount of forward runs he makes contributes to this (see Evra) albeit Evras legs went in the end.

2293~~~
Such a frustrating player.
Is Rafael really <i>so</i> out of favour that he cant even get a sub appearance to show what he can do?

2294~~~
he's fecking shit

2295~~~
The amount of times Mata and Herrera put him through for it to amount to nothing was ridiculous. Being 'solid defensively' will get you so far. Rafael would have been a far better suit today.

2296~~~
Delivery wasn't the best today, but he's a constant threat down the right. I mean, the amount of times he made sacrificing runs to open up the space for Mata was incredible.

2297~~~
The worlds best RB until he has to put a cross in. Never seen someone get into so many good positions but then feck it up.

2298~~~
Always solid and good help for Mata and Herrera, surely better than Rafael, but I expect us to sign Coleman or Clyne.

2299~~~
Better than Rafael how exactly, do people just forget how good Rafael can be for us, or are they just that blinded by the mediocrity we have watched from turn back tony for nigh on 3 years.

2300~~~
Fixed

2301~~~
Rafa wouldn't offer anything different than Valencia, who actually has more pace.

2302~~~
Would be nice to see Rafael get a chance. I think he offers a bit more going forward and is better defensively.

2303~~~
He's just disgusting going forward. He'll put half his crosses in the stands and the others reach no one. Most wasteful players from good positons I've seen.

2304~~~
Relentless running w/o any quality. The amount of times he got in behind the defence only to be let down by his crossing <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

2305~~~
I don't see where all the Valencia hate is coming from. Apparently there are limited things to moan about after a 3-1 win.

2306~~~
Rafael's final ball may be better but there's no way he would be getting into the sort of positions Valencia does all game long. His stamina and work rate off the ball are immense and it's often overlooked just how important that is.

2307~~~
He's steady enough, but it's fecking annoying watching someone who was (one of) the best winger(s) in the league a few years ago to being so blunt even at right back where he has more time and space. Defensively he's good against kick and rush merchants, impenetrable even, but he's not a natural defender. I'm surprised Rafael can't get a look in, because he's not exactly setting the bar high.

For the "Fergie/Moyes/LvG loved him crew so he must be good" please note that neither Fergie or Moyes never played Valencia over Rafael at RB. They played him at RW, mainly because the other options were out of form Young and out of form, injured, lacking confidence (and a couple of years ago, almost out of contract) Nani. It's not like LvG hasn't made errors either (let's not start on 352 or Rooney in midfield...)

2308~~~
You should watch some of the Rafael performances from earlier this season. He was immense bombing down the wing.

2309~~~
Dreadful today. Where has this idea come from that he is "solid defensively"? His attempted challenge on Weimann in the box just before Benteke shot over was pathetic and once again he conceded needless fouls around the box when the pressure was on.

Just as he was exposed against Arsenal, it would be crazy to start him against City, but start he will. He keeps the ball well and is fast but offers nothing else.

2310~~~
Rubbish, he's infinitely better going forward, put Rafael in those positions and he'll be making something of them. He's a much for progressive player, he wants to attack, his first instinct is to go forward whereas Valencia has to almost be forced to attack.

2311~~~
Rooney got a goal and was involved in the 3rd after moving to midfield today. Just saying.

Agree re: Valencia though.

2312~~~
Quite an apt description. Off the ball, he does nearly everything right. His defenders solidly. His work rate is enormous. His link up play in the build up is mostly very very good, but then he either dithers, or he blasts a cross out for a throw.

He only had one good delivery today, the one that Fellaini headered into the ground. Should have been a goal.

I still rate him as our most reliable RB though, as he's very strong defensively, and seems able to last the distance both on the pitch, and playing game after game without getting crocked.

2313~~~
His delivery is diabolical.

2314~~~
Showed for it all day on the right but his delivery was terrible nearly every time.

2315~~~

2316~~~
I think Valencia has improved under LVG but he is not the player we need at RB to play with Mata and Herrera in the triangles.  If we can get a fast and confident RB that can actually take defenders on and cross with consistency then that right side could prove all sorts of problems.  As it is now they do well but Valencia just cannot provide any consistency in his final balls.

2317~~~
What nonsense. He's really not "infinitely better" going forward, or else he would be playing. If anything Rafa is randomly reckless at times, which doesn't remotely justify him starting over Valencia, who has done a good job.

2318~~~
Valencia gets caught out less defensively, whilst Rafael is a better attacking option. Neither are bad players, but LVG's choice tells you what he ultimately looks for in a full back - and right now, it's working. So don't change it!

2319~~~
It's beyond daft. He's doing everything we need right now. Having a right back who takes more risks would be counter productive considering the creativity we already have on the field.

2320~~~
Did you see that tackle by Valencia in the first half on Delph (I think)? That was a reckless challenge. He does that sort of thing all the time but doesn't get a reputation as being reckless because he is such an emotionless character.

2321~~~
Bring back Beckham to teach him how to cross please.

2322~~~
He tries guys, he fecking TRIES. How can none of you appreciate that?

2323~~~
If Valencia had a good final ball he'd be one of the best right backs around really. The guy is a tank physically, always a reliable outlet, links up really well with Mata and Herrera and offers that side of the pitch the physical presence that Fellaini offers on the other side. Can be so frustrating with the little fouls and bad final ball though.

2324~~~
It's not just the final ball. It's the hesitancy to even try and do something. He's had that problem ever since 2012. It's one of the most infuriating things.

2325~~~
Well shit happens. De Gea, one of the world's top keepers had a howler today. The main thing is how the team played collectively, which is why Van Gaal isn't likely to start randomly swapping players out to experiment.

2326~~~
I think the annoying thing is he clearly used to know how to cross and take a man on, that's exactly what he built his career on!. His first season for us had some beautiful crosses. Since then though it's like he's forgotton how to cross apart from that stupid chip cross he does. 

If he can get his attacking game back together he would be a great rb.

2327~~~
It is really incredible that fans who would have watched full backs like Denis Irwin and Gary Neville can think that Antonio Valencia is good defensively at right back. It just beggars belief.

2328~~~
At first it's because he was getting doubled up on, then it was because he didn't have anyone playing infront of him, and now it's not actually important for him to put in any decent crosses, it's just about giving space to other players by being there. Standards, where have they gone?

2329~~~
Come back Rafa, we can do better than solid..

2330~~~
Clyne isn't the answer. Nobody would have wanted him before this season started.

2331~~~
Valencia has been very good, apart from his final ball (as usual) but tbh hes done well. Better @ RB than RM

2332~~~
I think he's been instructed specifically to float that cross into the back post and let Fellaini do the rest because he is matched up against the right back.

2333~~~
There is solid and then there's quality.  Valencia is solid.

2334~~~
You're kidding right? Even the most die hard Valencia fans will tell you he serious lacks with the final ball, smashing the ball as hard as he can at the nearest defender or playing a 3 yard pass backwards doesn't always cut it unfortunately. I just loath the bolded part as an argument, would you have been saying the same thing about Herrera when Rooney was starting in front of him in midfield? LVG clearly wants to keep consistency in his team until the end of the season hence the starting line up in the last 3/4 games.

2335~~~
Yes he does want to keep consistency, because things are working very well for us right now, which makes this obsession with Rafa "getting a game" all the more nonsensical. The team comes before any one player.

2336~~~
Agreed on all fronts. I would have done a better job than Valencia today.

The only good news is he'll soon be thirty, so even if we insist on keeping him he'll have to retire eventually.

2337~~~
Its not him "getting a game" like some charity, a lot of people genuinely think he's the better player. Its naive to think we still can't improve on what we currently have without bringing in new players, we've still got a lot more growing room within this team. I, like others identify Valencia as the current weak link within the starting XI and feel Rafael will improve us there, its hardly nonsensical.

2338~~~
Van Gaal obviously disagrees with this so why bother with a campaign ? If he wants to bring in a new RB next year all of this will be moot, but for now, the manager rates Valencia as better for the team, as opposed to better individually.

2339~~~
How would Rafael possibly do any worse than Valencia? I cant see how a right back is going to throw off our team's rhythm.

2340~~~
No you wouldn't.

2341~~~
He improves us for 2-3 games, and then gets injured. It's a constant disruption and Valencia is a good player with different qualities that compliment Herrera and Mata, and he is always fit. The most important thing with the defence is to stay fit and build an understanding like they have now.

2342~~~
Valencia hasn't done a bad job and LvG obviously considers him more useful to his formation and tactics than Rafa. Its actually more destablizing to randomly swap out players in a successful formation, which is one thing Van Gaal was criticized for when we were struggling. So why do it now ? The correct answer is, we shouldn't.

2343~~~
Oh. Thanks for pointing that out.

2344~~~
Yeh I don't think even an in form Rafael is worth constantly disrupting our already fragile defence. We're better going with stability.

2345~~~
Come on Raoul, this a forum, its where people come to give their opinions, its hardly a campaign.

2346~~~
It wasn't meant for you really, just a general thought. Just a bit bizarre that people are so easily willing to fiddle with a successful lineup that has clearly worked for us.

2347~~~
Rafael is ten times the player Valencia is going forward. Don't see why that's even a debate.

2348~~~
It's not just that... Valencia barely qualifies as a footballer. He's an athlete who looks like he belongs in gymnastics or weightlifting, not a football pitch.

2349~~~
Ferguson always, always tinkered with his line up regardless of team form.

2350~~~
Hasn't worked very well for LvG so far, so why risk it at such a critical point in the season.

2351~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Well I guess this sums up the extent of your credibility in the football forums.

2352~~~
Not always, moreso by the end when the most of our squad was squad players who were all similar in quality so we'd rotate until someone picked up form. We probably went too far with the rotation at times anyways.

2353~~~
Credibility? You want to talk about credibility? I'm a Manchester United fan who watches as many matches as I can from the comfort of his couch, and post somewhat regularly on a bloody message board because it interests me. I have ZERO credibility about anything, nevermind Manchester United.

But that's me. I take it you're coming from a far more enlightened perspective, so don't worry about my useless 2p.

2354~~~
Some fan you are - ranting about how one of our players barely qualifies as a footballer and instead belongs in gymnastics.

2355~~~
I know. Isn't that just the most over the top criticism you've ever heard by a fan (whom it's already been established has no credibility anyway) on an online message board?

Need I remind you and anyone else who's interested that this very thread, his official thread on tis forum had "performances" in brackets because it was so widely understood that he was rubbish that it wasnt even a point of contention with anybody.

2356~~~
Well it was a bit unwise at a minimum.

2357~~~
Perhaps. And this is a waste of my time to be talking trash about a player after we got a good result, I know.

So I'll leave this be for another day... <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2358~~~
I agree with this. He's composed with the ball and combines very well with others. Always felt he should score more than he does, maybe it's confidence with him and once he gets one off he'll feel better to start seizing responsibility. If it doesn't work for the first couple of times he seems to drop off and just contend with doing his basic job, which is solid but he certainly is capable of more. Rafael has more urgency about him but defensively he gives the feeling he's always on the edge. Van Gaal talks about making the players think about football, Rafael is instinctive. Coach that out of him and he's half the player, which is why I don't see a future for him.

2359~~~
I felt he was actually more attacking today and willing to try things than he has been for quite some time. Still not enough, but better.

Wish Rafa would get a chance though. Obviously won't be in the next two matches against City and Chelsea, but hopefully he'll get an opportunity after that and show enough that he's kept in for the last few matches.

2360~~~
Can't criticize his individual performance because don't expect much from him. However, he seems to have a good understanding with Mata and Herrera and it helps the team.

2361~~~
He's quite obviously holding us back though. Just look at how much Blind created on the left compared to Valencia. Valencia put in a lot of work today and made a lot of good runs, but the quality simply isn't there when it really matters. A new right back (seeing as Rafael seemingly won't get another game under LVG) is very much needed.

2362~~~
Valencia's understanding with Mata and Herrera is fantastic. I love that trio.

Valencia did hit a few awful crosses today, but he still made a couple of chances. Like one for Fellaini to head and I think he also tied up Rooney for that over-head kick attempt. 

He had a bad day at crossing, but I still think people are being too harsh on him. He's an effective player for us.

2363~~~
He's about as shite as ever. We've had to put up with him for so long now though that he has effectively managed to lower expectations everyone has to the point where a mediocre display is seen as solid. Well done to him for that I suppose.

2364~~~
He tries. He's doing as good as I expected him to. He may not be great but he's consistent enough. Since LVG clearly doesn't rate Rafa, I just hope we bring in a good RB.

2365~~~
he does a solid job that's it, Van Gaal likes him as he is experienced and is professional as much as player can be - the fact that he doesn't smile makes him look even more professional. He has got good strength and athleticism, it's harsh to say he's not footballer as this is also part of football, technically he's not bad, depends on what act we are talking about, he can dribble quite well his crossing is worse.. apart everything said, he's always fit which makes him even more dependable, Van Gaal wants a dependable player and overall dependable defense who plays as many games together as possible, he won't change it now until Tony V gets injured or has a really bad game, that's pretty much how Van Gaal did it all season.

Rafael will get his chance next year I guess - more games more rotations, less risks - right now we just need to snatch the top four and the team is going well now so why would you change it? Thats's Van Gaal's thinking 

My thinking would be: Tony, you'r sitting on the bench next weekend, I'm getting sick of your 6/10 performances.. you need to fight more for your place.

Rafael wouldn't have a worse game than Valencia, he's better defender and better going forward, this Herrera-Mata link up would be utilized even better with him in the side as he's certainly more intelligent player and is not preprogrammed as robot as Valencia is. 

But I'm not mad at LVG now, I'm saving my anger for when he starts picking RVP straight away and not playing him in reserves a single game...

2366~~~
occasionally he remembers he has terrific pace and strength, and just goes for it down the wing, and it normally goes well.

But hi signature move is still "the statue", of just stopping dead with it for no apparent reason.

Tidy job and keeps possession well. A paint by numbers performance.

2367~~~
Eh?

I think he is a good right back. How many times during a game does a fullback put a chance on a plate like he did for Fellani today? If Fellani does what he is supposed to do and score that I bet the whole assessment of Valencia's performance would change for you. I think that expectations are skewed beyond reason these days.

2368~~~
If he could take a decent cross he would be very good in the current system. Mata and Herrera kept on playing him into good crossing positions today but Tony kept on mishitting them.

2369~~~
His a fecking tank on the wing. Runs non-stop and nigh-impossible to barge off the ball.

2370~~~
It's always difficult to accept that a player has mastered a new position and not see him as a temporary stand in. To be fair, Valencia's transition has gone very well. He's very solid defensively and it's not a worry to see him start at the back. It's the attacking part that's, well, still the old Valencia. Not very clever and not good enough.

Since Rafael is done here (<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>) and we'll need two right backs there's no reason why Valencia shouldn't stay. But we should be looking for an upgrade.

2371~~~
He's just not very smart as a footballer, is he... It shows up all the more clearly when he's around Mata, Herrera, Carrick, Blind and Rooney (Young and Fellaini seem to me to be somewhere in the middle in this regard). 

His movement is a bit linear (up and down), which can work fine because he's got so much pace and strength. But his passing is so very frustrating, he's almost always got options to pass to as soon as he receives it, and yet opts to stand still for several seconds before executing the pass he should have played first time, by which point the defenders are all back in position.

As others have said, I don't blame LVG for not messing with a combination that's working, but one does wonder how much more fluid we could look with Rafael in there instead. 

Still, you have to admit he's adapted very well to the position (full time) an has been very solid.

2372~~~
Its genuinely quite hard to believe this guy used to be a winger, and was our main creative outlet for a season or two.

He's now a better defender then he is an attacker. Its quite bizzare.

2373~~~
The 2nd dumbest player we have in the team, by this season performance (Jones takes the crown, when Anderson left). Such a contrast with his opposite side in defence.

2374~~~
Its a tribute to his versatility. He made a few cameos at RB a couple of years ago and did very well, which is probably why LvG is using him. He's a capable defender with a lot of RW experience.

2375~~~
That pass to Fellani before the Rooney penalty shout was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> . He has everything in his locker, short, long passes, shot, pace but he doesn't try that often which is the problem. Crossing was off on 2-3 occasions today but still created three chances (Rooney penalty, overhead and Fellani header).

2376~~~
He's become a very confident passer now. I don't know how that's happened!

2377~~~
Agree totally but then Valencia has everything Blind lacks. If we can get this guy playing to a set of instructions he could be brilliant. Was sitting next to a fan yesterday that all he done was shout "run you lazy twat" I don't know what game he was watching as Valencia covered some amount of ground yesterday albeit his crossing was off. But there was one incident where the lack of brains was apparent with the Herrera pass and Mata and Herrera looked at Tony who just didn't see he should have continued his run and gave him some stick.

2378~~~
I've been critical of him in the past but to say he hasn't made any improvement over this season is a bit off the mark. When he held the right winger position, my impression was he was not doing enough to aid our attacks on a regular basis as his delivery was poor. At right back you get more out of him, he uses his strength and pace to his advantage and very rarely do I seem beaten by the opposition attacker. He still offers some attacking threat I mean he does have a couple of assists to his name playing mostly at RB so give him credit when its due.

2379~~~
Oh


Oh he's much better at right back this season than his last few seasons as right winger, no doubt about that. Shite was overly harsh, but we definitely need an upgrade there if we aren't going to play Rafael. He's still prone to lapses in concentration defensively and his hesitation and lack of end product going forward is just excruciating to me. I admit i'm overly harsh on him these days because I am just totally fed up of him.

2380~~~
I don't get why people are complaining about his crossing yesterday when he actually created two chance from crosses. Did anyone create more?

2381~~~
I've never questioned his work rate, skill, mentality and his willingness to get stuck in. Valencia has the skill, speed, and ability to do <b>much much better</b> with the ability he has. But he does not. It's like he is the opposite of Lampard.

2382~~~
I don't think it actually is that good.

I was watching it yesterday and he's basically just a body. Mata and Herrara seem to intuitively link up but Valencia just stands around passes the ball on and then overlaps when Mata points and tells him to. 

I mean its not like they trip up each other or get in each others way, but its hardly breathtaking.

2383~~~
Just watching Saturdays match again, I gave him a 6 at the time but thinking about it now it should've been a 7.

2384~~~
You're being harsh.

Valencia's final ball lets him down but his movement is very good imo.

2385~~~
Anyone else noticed that he almost commits a foul throw every time he takes a throwing? Surprised he hasn't been penalised for it before, but he has a very peculiar way of tossing the ball and I cant put my finger on whats strange about it. Any ideas?!

2386~~~
The best he does is a decent job. I'd keep him for sure given he can put solid peformances, is hard working and every squad needs such plauers, but we really do need someone with actual quality in that position.

2387~~~
I had to chuckle at that one. They had done it almost to perfection a few minutes earlier.

2388~~~
I know he totally switched off I remember Berbatov used to tell Tony to just fecking run lol

2389~~~
Yeah he chucks it from in front of his face rather than take a legal throw in. There must have been a malfunction in his programming when he was manufactured.

2390~~~
Meh. Much like how officials in the NBA never blow the whistle for travelling violations, football officiating at the highest level seems to (rightly, imho) ignore foul throws.

2391~~~
I'm not too surprised about that, to be honest. He was always a very good passer of the ball who frequently made the right passes, and this is what helped him link up with Rafael, Rooney, Berbatov, Nani, etc., so well. In a way, he's quite a dependable player going forward because you know that he'll frequently make the right decisions.

However...

I also concur with this statement. Ever since the 2011/12 season, Valencia regressed. His confidence seemed to seep out of him, and he seemed to play slower, safer, and more cautiously than he ever did. We've seen how often he would just stop, jink around without really troubling the opponent, and hit the ball hard hoping that the ball either goes into the box or out for a corner/throw-in. He never seemed to take on the opposing marker anymore, and he never seemed to direct his crosses to players. He did seem to fix those issues with some of his good attacking performances this season, but he still shows his more conservative nature several times when he holds onto the ball for too long or doesn't make a run into space when Herrera/Mata are looking for it. This is where I feel Rafael can be an upgrade over Valencia along with him being better, overall, but I guess van Gaal prefer's Valencia's cautiousness going forward than Rafael's more adventurous attacking style.

2392~~~
He just understands Mata and Herrara so well. Beautiful to watch. I should note that the group on the left - Blind, Fellaini and Young - understand each other pretty well too.

2393~~~
It's not just them, though. Remember him + Rooney, Berbatov, and Nani during the 2009/10 season? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2394~~~
The only thing he's not doing well enough right now is putting a decent ball in. 

Considering we have both Mata and Herrera already working that right hand side and have good service from Blind and Young on the opposite side, I'd say it's really not at the top of his priorities. 

What is important is that he supports Mata and Herrera (arguably two of our weakest players defensively) and facilitates them which he does very well.

2395~~~
He can't cross but I don't understand the criticism he's receiving here. He's been great defensively and he acts as a great foil for Herrera and Mata's moving about on that side.

2396~~~
Since that howler against the Arse he hasn't done much wrong to be honest

2397~~~
If you think, I guess not, he's good combinations with them from time to time but it could be better considering the potential Mattera offers. Valencia is one way player. Rafael plays with his head up and actually think about what he's doing. His flair is on different level to Valencia. I guess we will have to wait for it but once it is Mata, Herrera and Rafael on the right hand side we will completely destroy opponent.

Till now Valencia has been solid but you don't want to have too many solid players in your team.. we will see..

2398~~~
He's basically been brilliant for weeks but he's the whipping boy so people won't accept it. A couple of poor mistakes against the Arse but his form extends beyond that too.

Hard to see how he could have done better in his role over the last month or so.

2399~~~
He's done well this season, but we should aim higher. His position is probably the first we must improve in the summer.

2400~~~
Brilliant? No. I'd rather see Rafa get games. However Valencia is dependable. He's a strong lad. Offers great support, just needs a better final ball. Rafa would do just as well up that wing when we play with some fluidity. It looks a bit ominous however.

2401~~~
I agree. Rafa gives us a whole new dimension by himself and I'd love to see him with Mattera. The thing is Rafa can't last more than 3 games and that's not good when you're looking to build understanding and defensive stability. Valencia gives us an all round balance. If Rafa can stay as fit as Valencia then by all means!

2402~~~
It´s getting to the point that those slating him for his play against Villa are just being wankers. Even his crossing was quite good in that match.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZPwBaSJLpI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2403~~~
Agreed. It's odd because I feel as if Valencia's been far better than Young, over the past few games, yet the latter has been receiving a ridiculous amount of praise, whereas the former seems only to attract criticism... At least the man in charge of the club doesn't see it that way and has Valencia starting every game, and rightly so. He's been one of our most consistent performers this season and well done to him.

Oh and 0.50 seconds into the video... my word, that was an incredible pass.

2404~~~
Valencia is solid. But there's always this niggling feeling that even a slight improvement on the quality of RB, will resonance twice to the quality of our overall attacking play on the right. It just seems like Valencia is not only lessen the input from RB, but also shackled Herrera and Mata quality to truly shine that right side of the field.

2405~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.stretford-end.com/2015/04/valencias-renaissance-defender-key-united/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.stretford-end.com/2015/04/valencias-renaissance-defender-key-united/</a>

He’s won a club-high 86% of his club-high 90 tackles, a ridiculous feat given that he makes a tackle more often than any other player in the squad (every 22 minutes). He’s also made a club-high 144 ball recoveries (recovering the ball when it’s gone loose in play), that’s one every 14 minutes, unsurprisingly also more often than any other player in the squad. Going forwards he has a better cross completion rate than Di Maria and has the second highest number of assists after the Argentinian. He seldom gives the ball away either; only Rooney and Blind have played more passes but neither boast the 90% accuracy he does.

2406~~~
Some negatives to provide the usual balance to this argument:

Not Rafael
Still Antonio Valencia
Has made a couple of mistakes over the course of the season

2407~~~
It's really starting to get boring, he gets the most unfair criticism at this club. If he reinvents his attacking quality, we arguably have one of the best/most complete rb in the league.

2408~~~
Hark at those stats. A whole year of scouting potential first choice right backs is futile after seeing those.

2409~~~
I think he will be our first choice right back next season and while it might take a while, people will come around to him and realise how solid he actually is there once the pundits start highlighting his work

2410~~~
Are they accurate though?

I don't know where the check them all but the second highest number of assists is surely wrong, according to soccerway he has two. Mata, Rooney, Falcao and Herrera have all got double that.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://uk.soccerway.com/teams/england/manchester-united-fc/662/squad/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://uk.soccerway.com/teams/england/manchester-united-fc/662/squad/</a>

2411~~~
Herrera and Mata are in the best form of their United lives, yet Valencia is guilty of shackling them?

Is this how low the criticism can go?

2412~~~

2413~~~
He's consistent, defends fairly well, works hard, has good link up play and is even a good passer when he's not crossing the ball. For a RB that's a pretty good mix to have but I can't get over his a)his poor crossing from great positions and b)his reluctance to take the full back on. That's mainly down to how good and deadly he has been over the years as a winger for us. In time, I reckon I'll get over his decline as a winger and emergence as a very solid RB for United.

2414~~~
It's so easy to make any player look good with using the stats that fits him. Well, the stats are definitely telling (almost) nothing in this case.

First, whoscored have him as having 3.1 tackles per game, so that means he makes tackle every 29 minutes, and not 22 like said in that site, and whoscored is usually most reliable sources for this stuff. But fair enough, he still makes more tackles than any other player.

As for his other defensive contribution, he is only 12th highest by clearances in the squad, 11th highest by interceptions, 9th highest in blocked shots, but highest from all defenders in number of fouls given against him per game(which is bad btw, just from watching the games you can see that he has a bad habbit of giving away silly fouls,similar to Fellaini).

So, basically his defensive stats are actually very average, probably even poor.

Also, worth mentioning that from mentioned stats, Rafael is weaker than him only at tackling, at every other defensive contribution he has better stats.

As for that recovered ball stats, I can't find it, but I don't doubt he bulks them up by winning back possession after his blocked crosses anyway.

And the passing stats is misleading too. Yes, only Mata has better passing accuracy, but it tells you nothing when Valencia makes less passes than 7 other players per game, someone like Blind makes almost 15 more passes per game, and it's really not difficult to tell how creative Valencia is his with passing in comparision with someone like Herrera, Carrick, Rooney, etc.

The assists stat is just a lie, nothing else, he only has 2 assists, same as Carrick, Blind and van Persie, and less than 5 other players, even though he is our third most featured outfield player this season(just 40 mins short of 2nd place).


Stats are great. Can I now make a thread to show that Rafael is better defensively looking through the stats?

2415~~~
<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

2416~~~
His profile at the top of this page has 5 assists this season.  Not that anything on here is credible <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2417~~~
I don't get the Valencia hate. Van Gaal clearly rates him over Rafa at the moment so lets kick on and see where this goes.

2418~~~
I'm still not convinced by his defensive ability. He's improved from last season where he was a complete liability and he completely trumps the kick and run merchants. But he doesn't have the brains of a defender, and doesn't convince me positionally or against smarter wingers. It helps that we generally don't do much defending due to our possession and that there are a big number of purely pace merchants in the league, but I could see us getting found out in Europe next season for example.

One thing I've noticed though, is that there is a large number of people who refuse to criticise Valencia at all. I can see why he's fairly likeable, but at the end of the day the bloke has gone from one of the best wingers in the league, to a full back who's better at defending than he is attacking, and he's no fecking Paolo Maldini either at the back. But he's gone backwards so much and there's a huge block of people who keep lowering their standards to praise him. Which if you compare to someone like Rooney who gets shit from daring not to be as good as Ronaldo and Messi, I think there's a big undeserved love in for Valencia.

2419~~~
He is part of a system, which is coming into fruition. Could you not state the same about Young ? Wasnt he a winger before ? Has he now not won the critics over by mastering his new position ? The correlation between praising somebody for interchanging (lowering the standards) in positions doesnt convince me at all. There are plenty of members who have criticized Valencia for his one dimensional performances and there are enough members as well who even advocated a transfer because of that exact reason. The reason why Valencia is well liked as a person is because of the way he is carrying himself. Very demure, not seeking the spotlights and giving every inch of his lungs whenever he plays. I would actually argue that Valencia is more self-aware in regards of how to position himself and how to distribute the ball. That is Van Gaal in every way. Motivating players to use their cognitive abilties, but thats another topic. I would like to know which members are criticizing Wazza for not being on the same level as Messi and Ronaldo, because at least 99.99% of the footballers around the globe arent, so that would be a silly case to argue in my opinion. Anyway, i think Valencia as a right back has grown into many fans. This summer will one way or the other provide some answers regarding the fullback position.

2420~~~
I just laugh at the hate he gets these days. Its hilarious that some think hes playing out of position, or he is wank. Its like the less rafael plays the more god like he becomes. While the more valencia does well the more shit some posters think he is. I'm sure given the option city fans would wish Rafa played over Toby V tomorrow. 

He makes the odd mistake and is slaughtered on here like rafael is some master right back that does no wrong and makes the perfect right back performance every time. fact is, he is playing over rafael because he is simply playing better that him at the moment.

2421~~~
I don't see the 'hates' here. It just people have differences in rating him.

2422~~~
Maybe Valencia does a "decent' job but Rafael would do a wonderful job. That's what's frustrating about Valencia starting. And I'm sure it'll hit LvG suddenly one day just like the decisions to put Rooney up top, play Herrera and give Mata games. It's fairly obvious but takes LvG ages to figure.

2423~~~
Or... it'll take a while for Rafael to figure out how to play in Van Gaal's system and until then he will remain outcast. Just like Herrera was.

2424~~~
I'm reminded of the debate about Carrick a few years ago when his defenders were hiding behind stats when it was clear that he was not the same player from the season or two before. The posters who pointed this out were called haters and derided as not being as knowledgeable as his die hard fans. 

Nobody doubts Valencia's heart and commitment. Everyone loves the fact that he's not an ego manic whose off the field antics are in the papers every week. He's a good pro. He's solid. He gives everything. All the things people say when they're defending him are true. But he's not that good at either defending or attacking and we should be looking for a replacement, in my opinion. He is not the best there is in the RB/RMF/RW/RWB position and the best is what we should always be aspiring to. 

I look at the stats about recovering the ball and, on the face of it, they are impressive. What they don't tell you, however, and it's something that is apparent when you watch him play, is that he's the reason he lost the ball in the first place, with an awful first touch. He is in the Stewart Downing at Liverpool mould, in that he runs at defenders, stops, then plays the ball back to a team mate a very high percentage of the time. And when he reaches the byline, he's going to smash it low and hard, hitting the first defender the vast majority of the time. 

If you watch him doing this week in, week out, and you are satisfied with that, then I don't know what to tell you. But I'm used to wingers who can beat people and full backs who can cross the ball. Dani Alves on a free would hopefully make you see what you're missing.

2425~~~
Criticise him for a lot of things but his first touch and ball retention is impeccable so that is just bollocks.

Secondly, he's not a winger, he's a fullback with two creative players working the channel ahead of him.

Thirdly, here's the comparison to Dani Alves who plays in a team that has scored 87 goals this season compared to United's 55. Alves has 4 assists compared to Valencia's 2.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/ho6llfb.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/ho6llfb.png"/>

2426~~~
Absolutely shocking from Valencia there.

2427~~~
Does anyone actually want to play against the likes of Barca, Bayern and Madrid and other UCL opposition with Valencia as our right back?

2428~~~
But think about the statistics!

2429~~~
It more than likely will not be Rafael but, we are going to need a real RB starting at RB next season.

2430~~~
I've banged on about Valencia being defensively solid nearly all season, but he looks dizzy. He doesn't seem to know where to be, who to mark, where the danger is. Doesn't seem to do anything when City get behind him with the ball, which is unlike him. His defensive game has been top this season, but he's just everywhere he shouldn't be so far.

2431~~~
He's been decent enough. Massive overreaction to single him out.

2432~~~
Epic defending from Tony. Saved us a goal just now.

2433~~~
Aye, did very well just there.

2434~~~
It was a great recovery from him but it was terrible from Aguero and I agree with Neville that his positioning was pretty poor to begin with too.

2435~~~
Not sure if I slept through the first few minutes but he's been quite good.

2436~~~
People are actually complaining <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Give the guy a fecking break please. He's had a very good half.

2437~~~
His own mistake in the first place.

2438~~~
Started badly like 100% of our players. been very good since like the rest of them. 

Nothing to see here.

2439~~~
Smalling has had to cover for him as he slowly jogs back time and again. He's extremely lazy getting back. He's been decent going forward, but that was screaming out for a first time cross to Fellaini at the end who was unmarked. He took a touch and Zabaleta got back

2440~~~
It was his fault to begin with, the centreback steps up you step up. Played him onside and if it weren't for the bad first touch he wouldn't have had the time to recover from his mistake.

2441~~~
More like Smalling's ridiculous offside trap attempt.

2442~~~
He recovered nicely. The pitchfork brigade need to take a seat.

2443~~~
Hazard next week <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2444~~~
Who cares, he recovered nicely and we kicked on.

2445~~~
He gets caught far too inside too often but his physicality saved us.

2446~~~
Positionally he's not there yet but the way he shuts players like Aguero down is brilliant.

2447~~~
People would be salivating if Rafael were playing like Valencia has been. People are too set in their opinions to let reality make a difference to them.

2448~~~
This, Smalling is practically playing right back half the time. I don't even know where Valenica is.

Foul throw-ins again. Wtf are our coaching staff doing? Have a word with him because it is fecking ridiculous.

2449~~~
Defensively poor like the other defenders, but offensively he's looked class. I see flashes of when he was at his prime much more often now.

2450~~~
He was completely all over the place that half. How many times did Smalling get dragged out wide to confront Milner? Look at him ball watching for their goal. He's strong and fast but a defender he ain't against clever opposition.

2451~~~
Has no idea where to position himself but great recovery against Aguero

2452~~~
He hasn't though, the goal was just fault, he dived in to begin with, waltzed back and stood and watched, Smalling has had to pull himself out of position to cover him several times, that last man tackle was to cover for his own mistake, an on form Augero wouldn't have given him the opportunity to amend for his mistake. That's two massive mistakes in 45 minutes.

2453~~~
He was generally disastrous for the first half hour or so but did a fantastic job recovering that situation where Aguero was through. Even if it was his own mistake. Grew into it towards the end.

2454~~~
He's been poor. City have had joy down his side and offensively he's offered nothing. That cross to Fellaini at the end of the half was appalling.

2455~~~
At least he was able to recover - that's part of the game as well.

2456~~~
I care, an on form Augero would've punished him. He was at fault for the first goal and could've been at fault for a 2nd.

2457~~~
You don't think the manager cares about such lazy mistakes?

I don't understand how he's been judged to have been beyond consideration for rotation with Rafael at this point

2458~~~
I agree the Rafael bashers would be having a field day.

2459~~~
I'm guessing you didn't see their first goal then?

2460~~~
He's not even on my TV screen half the time, what the feck is he doing?

2461~~~
While Smalling and Jones looked nervous anyway, and Blind had Navas run in behind him - it escalates the situation 5 fold when your CB is pulled out to right back every couple of minutes because Valencia is casually jogging back. It makes our thin backline even thinner

Really, the basics of playing right back are :

Positioning/responisibility (be in your position so your team can count on you)
Take throw ins properly (as a fullback you're going to be taking a lot of them, dont do it incorrectly and give the opposition the ball)
Support your winger

Valencia does 1 of the 3 basics

2462~~~
Twice he's pointlessly slid in their area and allowed them half the pitch to counter down. He also left his spot completely open for a chance for Milner who was free for ages before a pass finally found him. And he's muscled Aguero off from a certain goal after a horrendous initial position. All brawn no brain - typical Valencia, once again.

2463~~~
Yep, Büttner esque, he was 5m behind the "offside trap".

2464~~~
He's thick as shit. Even that piece of defending when he outmuscled Aguero is because he didn't read the offside trap.

2465~~~
Rafael played better in his first season as a kid with no positioning ability than Valencia has been playing

2466~~~
This has been his worst game in a while. Mata needs to track back more and help him out.

2467~~~
The irony of this is hilarious. There are no Rafael bashers

2468~~~
I did. Thought Carrick could've done better there.

2469~~~

Feck me you are really clutching at straws to beat this man with. Lol if that's the basics of playing right back then I don't know.

2470~~~
GIF of his recovery against Aguero?

2471~~~
Probably because the manager prefers Valencia's style over Rafa.

2472~~~
I thought it was Carrick's fault as well - never imagined it being Valencia's fault before I saw this thread....

2473~~~
But he's never been overrun, his problems haven't come from that. It seems like im being overly harsh on him but he's not a fullback, period.

2474~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Just give Valencia credit for good defending ffs.

2475~~~
You really dont know.

2476~~~
He can't fart without someone bumping this thread mid match to have a moan.

2477~~~
What you are thinking?

2478~~~
When is playing Aguero onside good defending?

Is that English?

2479~~~
If Rafael had done that Aguero bit of defending, then people would've heralded him as the new Cafu. It's actually pathetic how some people try to discredit him.

2480~~~
Too often he and Smalling are swapping, with Smalling coming out to the right back position and Valencia to centre back. I guess this is because Valencia bombs on a lot, but we need to make sure we follow runners from midfield.

The bit where he caught Aguero and jockeyed him out was class.

2481~~~
Throw ins one of the 3 basics <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2482~~~
<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/> Of all the players to blame you blame Carrick? It was Valencia rushing out of position, jogging back and ball watching that caused all the problems.

2483~~~
That made me chuckle; thanks Raoul <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2484~~~
Not sure he tucks his shirt in properly either.....

2485~~~
Rafael would be chastised for playing City's most dangerous player onside

2486~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2487~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> OK OK, he recovered well <span style="color: #ffffff">even if it was his fault to begin with...</span>

2488~~~
Carrick just stood there, and I thought that players covered for each other when one is out of position; why nobody followed the run in the middle is also beyond me. We'll win this anyhow, so who cares <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2489~~~
It was carrick covering so yeah, his mistake also .-) Valencia on the other hand did great work to chase down Aguero on the break.

2490~~~
I doubt he can fart anyway. That's a natural body function. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2491~~~
The real question is, if Smalling is covering right back in 9 times out of 10 City attacks, is it even Valencia being out of position or is Smalling actually playing right back?

2492~~~
You in here as well Ekeke looking to beat this guy? Lol he's actually playing well why you choosing these moments? Strange from you as you are usually a good poster!

2493~~~
Great recovery play in terms of the Aguero chance but he did show he still has defensive frailties, which is no shame since he's been converted from a winger. Will be replaced as the first choice RB in the summer but he's shown that he can be a very good back-up RB now. To be fair to him though, the players which you are touted as being interested in such as Coleman and Clyne have those mistakes in their game too, but they are able to recover from them by their pace, like Valencia does with his strength.

2494~~~
Improved drastically in this half in my opinion. Much more on the ball defensively.

2495~~~
Yeah, this. Awful for the first half hour or so, and I've been one of Valencia's biggest fans this season, but he was ghastly, and his mental positioning cost us a goal. Much better towards the end of the first half, and throughout the 2nd.

2496~~~
Absolutely superb.

2497~~~
Brilliant in the second half - no doubt about that, one should think. He probably made a weird throw in though.

2498~~~
Tony V for president

2499~~~
Haven't been a big fan of Valencia, but he did very well today after a shaky start.

2500~~~
He did a very important close down at an important stage of the game.

2501~~~
Pathetic defending for their first goal, but some quality stuff after that.

2502~~~
I'm drawing focus on whats important

Terry and Carragher are always criticized on here for playing players onside then making a dramatic tackle. Valencia does it and its different? Its very small to be changing the rules based on whether a player is on your team or at a rival's.

Having said that, City barely managed an attack in the 2nd half and Valencia did better. He made some good tackles and was good going forward.

But he will cost us again if he doesn't dramatically improve his positioning and the pace he gets back into his position. Its championship standard.

2503~~~
One of his better performances. He was all over the place and played his heart out.

2504~~~
Good enough today.

2505~~~
He's a fecking machine. Whatever food he has, it should be United main menu.

2506~~~
Very good today

2507~~~
Great today!

2508~~~
Beastmode !!!

2509~~~
He played well today. One of his better performances as RB.

2510~~~
Slowly but surely people will come around to him.

2511~~~
Does it matter as long as he has the pace to recover? I don't care much if he stands holding his ehrm pencil at the opposition half as long as he is able to get back and intercept or tackle. The way he outpaced Clichy with Clichy having a head start, starting a counter is something that is so vital. Rafael isn't much slower, so not sure if the pace card is the be all for Valencia, but he is good at using it to his advantage, compared to last season where he was just standing still.

2512~~~
Played well once we had passed the game out of City. Its the second big side that's he's been found hopelessly wanting against. Thought Blind on the other side had a poor game today too.

2513~~~
He's a beast

2514~~~
MOTM for me. Someone needs to gif that defensive job on Aguero.

2515~~~
A couple of positioning errors aside he was brilliant today

2516~~~
He is just so strong and fast. If he had a footballing brain he would be a top class player

2517~~~
He's not recovering. He's casually jogging back at a leisurely pace, so someone (usually the RCB Smalling) is forced to go take up his position at right back for the coming move.

Almost everyone thinks our defence needs a new CB in the summer, so how can anyone be okay with making our current CBs jobs a lot harder with suicidal play like that? Instead of protecting our defence, Valencia exposes it

Again thats not to say he doesnt do anything well. He made good tackles and did well going forward with his energy and his final ball was better than normal. Incidently these are all things 19 year old Rafael did in his first season at the club.

But playing Valencia at right back is like putting a bullet in a revolver's chamber, spinning it, placing it in your mouth and pulling the trigger. We'll get away with it some of the time, at other times its going to be the end of us

2518~~~
I recall one FIFA game where you could create players and you had a given amount of points to create that player and place those points in various attributes like technique, awareness, speed, strength etc. It seems the real world is like that too. Imagine Mata's technique and passing in Valencia's body...

2519~~~
Would be number 1 Ballon d'or candidate.

2520~~~
Do you think there's a player out there busting his lungs and making more sprints than Valencia? He stopped three or four very dangerous City attacks today due to his speed. If you want him to contribute in attack, he will leave gaps in defense, and I have no problem with Smalling covering his flank if Carrick drops into Smalling's spot, which he should and does most of the time. 

I think you are far too harsh on him. He was one of our better players today, and has been this season.

2521~~~
He would be awesome on FIFA <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2522~~~
Improved edition of Ronaldo?

2523~~~
I dont think you're watching when teams are building up down our right side because he's caught up the pitch, moving forward before he needs to. He's casually jogging back before he's made a single lungbusting sprint

He's being lazy defensively so that he has that energy to burst forward when it suits him. Thats a winger's trait. They can get away with it. Defenders cant cheat

If we had Rio and Vidic in their prime at CB it wouldnt be as much of an issue. Its exactly what Evra did after a couple of years, with Vidic having to bail him out every 5 mins

2524~~~
Superb in the 2nd half.

2525~~~
Terrific performance. Saved a clear goal by tracking Aguero. But as usual the caf moans.

2526~~~
Improved Ronaldo? Is that possible? But possibly, yeah. It would be interesting to see Ronaldo vs Valencia at RB - not sure if Ronaldo would be able to outpace him actually, but possibly outsmart him.

2527~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> feck sake!

2528~~~
I don't agree. When players, like Herrera often does, tracks back because Valencia is further up the pitch, there's no reason for Valencia to bust his lungs getting back - that's not lazy defending, that's team play.

2529~~~
He was considerably better both going forward and defensively in the second half so it has little to do with that. He had terrible defensive judgement in the first half as he is prone to, however did really well in the second half.

2530~~~
Its not about busting lungs, its about not doing it at a snail's pace so that he can at least track the fullback helping the winger Smalling is facing as the RB. Instead he's too late for even that

2531~~~
At fault for the goal. What was he doing.

2532~~~
Some massive blind spots from some posters IMO. Like he can do no wrong - today's mistake was Carrick's fault for not covering him, his backpass vs arsenal was Jones's fault for chesting the pass wrong.

<a class="username" data-user="21825, @Ekeke" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/21825/">@Ekeke</a> 's point about him not tracking back today is very true as well. Which is surprising because he's normally got a good engine and work rate. But it was worrying the number of times that Smalling was left covering wide today was worrying. There was a point in the 2nd half where there was a man free on in the LW position and Valencia was jogging back caught 40 yards upfield. It reminded me of Evra in his last season when his legs were shot.

2533~~~
made a few brain farts at the beggining but had a fantastic rest of game. Broke up numerous city attacks.

2534~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> It's like picking the things Valencia is not good at and adding them to the "basics"

You really are being incredibly harsh on him for some odd reason. He wasn't at fault for any of the goals.. well obviously not in the match you were watching.

2535~~~
Absolutely. Even the recovery tackle that he made was met with frenzied praise. Yes it was a good recovery tackle but it was his fault to begin with and if Augero had a better first touch he wouldn't have had the opportunity to recover. 2 critical mistakes almost completely ignored, he is the weak link in this team.

2536~~~
Definite weak link imo.

2537~~~
I just think we see it differently. When Herrera is covering, I see no problem with him not sprinting back because then Valencia is keeping Herrera's position to counter.

He's not perfect, but he played very well today, and he has played very well this season. There's been a lot of prophesies that he will struggle against the big teams, but he hasn't - he was very good today and excellent against Liverpool etc etc.

2538~~~
We're officially in silly territory.

2539~~~
I thought it was another good game overall for him, most of our attacks came down the left so he didn't get to murder any shins today but his power and pace were important in our defending.

2540~~~
He's a boss.

2541~~~
Two words: Beast Mode

2542~~~
The hell was he doing for the first goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I think we need someone better at linking up play as well, but other than that he's made some good tackles today.

2543~~~
I thought he was very solid , very important cog in our team, great stamina, touch and control are very good, rarely loses the ball, and is an absolute beast

Only thing, we all know is that he nullifies our attacking threat on right wing in big games

2544~~~
You can easily say he made three mistakes leading to goals against City today and arsenal in the Fa cup.

2545~~~
Because the caf loves Rafael who wouldn't play as a regular starter at Qpr or Burnely, like his bro Fabio.

2546~~~
There was one move in the 42nd minute in the first half when City broke into the area with pace and only him stood between Aguero and Silva and managed to force a goal kick from the former. Very impressive

2547~~~
Beast today. Great covering and made a bitch out of aguero a few times (as did Jones).

2548~~~
Awesome Today

2549~~~
Well said Rossa

2550~~~
Wasn't impressed with him in the first half but he was full of confidence after that race with Aguero. Total beast in the 2nd half.

2551~~~
Great today...a 'needs to be starting' type of performance. He works well with the Spaniards. Just wish he'd be a little more aggressive in attack but he's improving on that. Defended superbly at times.

2552~~~
Came here to post exactly this.

Absolutely terrible the 1st 20 odd mins but went into beast mode after that.

2553~~~
That footrace when Clichy was put through...<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

"Not now son"

2554~~~
Lets not get into daft mode.

2555~~~
This can be said for most of our squad during City's initial blitz.

2556~~~
At what point do we accept he's good enough to remain our right-back and isn't makeshift?

2557~~~
Bar that first 20 minutes he was an absolute beast. Some really impressive defensive contributions.

2558~~~
If he starts next year as RB, as it would clearly mean LvG rates him as his starter.

2559~~~
Not really, the rest of the guys werent asleep like he was. Valencia absolutely switched off twice in the 1st 10 odd mins. The goal and one another moment where it was Smalling(i think) who cut the move out at the last moment. Also couple of other moments when he was woefully out of position.

2560~~~
Yep, I honestly wouldn't take issue with this. He's been excellent this season at full-back.

2561~~~
Weird as it may sound considering he's a winger turned FB, I'm pretty happy most of the time with his defensive work, its what he does going forwards that isnt good enough especially given how beautifully Mata and Herrera work there.

2562~~~
Not quite there yet. 

Defensively he's solid enough it's his attacking play that lets him down, I'd love to see him take on and beat his man instead he always opts for an inside pass. I don't know why he doesn't back himself, he has the pace and muscle to get past weak fullbacks.

2563~~~
He's not a RB by trade so we are bound to see the odd lapse - his good points far outweighed any negative ones today.

2564~~~
A question to ask is perhaps the standard to compare him with ? Which RB in the Premier League is actually playing magnificent ?

2565~~~
Hes been good since that failed backpass against Arsenal. His crossing still needs work though but thought it was better today overall.

2566~~~
He's a tank.

2567~~~
Feck me, of all the things<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

2568~~~
Absolute beast today.

2569~~~
Was shite for their first goal and recovered well after letting Aguero go beyond the defence onside.

Was very good for the rest of the game though and his strength and pace are real assets. Still don't think he should be starting over Rafa or be our no. 1 RB next season though.

2570~~~
After all both him and Blind are not defenders and I don't fault them unless the made some basic mistakes you don't expect from a player of their quality

2571~~~
Did really well on Aguero on couple of occasions and was overall an improved defensive performance from him.

2572~~~
Oh absolutely. As I said in my original post, he went into absolute beast mode after the 1st 15mins or so. Brilliant performance overall.

2573~~~
I thought he's always a pretty useful player. I for one agreed with LVG's assessment of him for the arsenal fa cup game. Yes he made the mistake which gifted them the goal, but that is a lapse in concentration. How can you complain about him when he has otherwise been the best player on the pitch (arsenal game). Anyway other people have said it on here, the good outweighs the bad with Tony, especially the work rate. He's better at right back than a lot of natural right backs. Comparing with Rafael, he doesn't get injured as much as rafa does and has less mistakes in him than rafa.

2574~~~
?

Think a lot of Herrera and Mata's play is wasted by Valencia at times.

2575~~~
This place is a fecking loony bin. Either that or we have a lot of seriously proffesional WUMs. He is at mistake for the first goal (diving in, jogging back, ball watching, out of position) and then gets praised for recovering from his own feck up that Aguero should've finished before he had the chance to recover. Yet people are calling him a beast?!

2576~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> keep taking the pills...

2577~~~
What part of that do you disagree with?

2578~~~
All of it.

2579~~~
His own feck up? How was that Valencia's fault?

EDIT: Talking about the Aguero bit here. I do agree about him being at fault for the 1st goal. Started the game poorly.

2580~~~
Maybe I should lend you some of my pills then.

2581~~~
He played him onside to begin with, Smalling stepped forward, Valencia stepped back and way way behind the defensive line.

2582~~~
Would need to watch that again then as I dont remember it like that.

It still was superb defensive work to get a goal kick out of that. As was his rest of the game, bar the 1st 15 odd mins.

2583~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2584~~~
Have to admit, I wasn't a fan of him playing at RB but he has changed my mind this season. He was been immense in for the last few games. His power and pace gives Mata a lot of room to attack and do his own thing. I'm honestly sold on Valencia at RB.

2585~~~
Linking up play is one of his biggest assets and always has been. Even when he was utter shite people said he links up well with Rafael on the right, it's what he does next that's been a problem.

2586~~~
Positionally he's still getting caught out at times, but fortunately he can often make up for it with his pace and strength. 

I can see it going one of 2 ways for the Chelsea game... Hazard sits in Valencia's pocket for 90 mins OR Valencia gets caught out once or twice and we get punished.

2587~~~
Still feel like Herrera and Mata are making movements he's not picking up quick enough. Especially when he can only use his right foot.

2588~~~
Its not my fault he can't do the basics of a fullback role. They are very obvious.

How do you think lots of rightbacks make their careers in the game when they arent even close to the athletic ability of Valencia?

They aren't a liability positionally and don't foul throw everytime they are expected to take a throw in - which if you count it, its likely to be like 3 or 4 per half in a decent team. Those are the very basics you are taught at a young age, its not my fault if Valencia foul throws and is out of position all the time. Someone like Phil Bardsley can manage those things, they are very simple.

If anyone seriously thinks all a fullback needs to do is what Valencia does well, make some tackles and make runs, then I dont think they understand football. Its a team game, especially defensively and those are individual things that might catch the eye of the casual observer - same as sprinting back and tackling Aguero, but most of a fullback's game is not going to be a highlight reel. Everytime a fullback steps up and plays Aguero offside instead might not stand out as much, but its far better defending.

2589~~~
Yeah go to page 61/62 for the blowup of it. Do you think that for a defender 2 total feck ups, one resulting in a goal, the other that almost - is acceptable? I don't.

2590~~~
Ander's position isnt to counter. He's not a forward. We saw him in our own box making clearances today and he wasnt covering for a CB, he was just fulfilling his obligations as a CM.

Besides it was almost always Smalling pulling wide because Ander has work to do in the middle, and more often than not is pressing high up the pitch which can easily take him out of the game if he doesnt manage to pinch it

2591~~~
Give over. First goal he was certainly at fault (as were a few others) it was poor defending all round (though he was the main culprit) - but after that he was feckin' as solid as you want. I mean, you're getting at him for playing Sergio Aguero onside? Big sodding woop... So long as he atoned for the error (and he did so brilliantly) then who gives a flying toss? Playing someone marginally onside that high up the pitch isn't the biggest crime in the world - so he full deserves praise for snuffing out the chance. He also cut out a pass quite brilliantly in the second half that would have put Aguero through... as well as generally bullied Clichy/Milner/Silva up and down the pitch (which was pretty funny really).

2592~~~
He could still be so much more positive attacking, he always looks nervous and clueless. Defensively though he has been awesome, his 1 on 1 defending is some of the best as a fullback I can remember. People just struggle to get passed him on the outside due to his strength and speed.

2593~~~
Your capacity for talking utter balls - in a needlessly complicated way - never ceases to amaze. Well done.

2594~~~
If you find it complicated it would explain a lot.

2595~~~
Feck me he's strong, ay!

2596~~~
Your failure to grasp the meaning of the word "needlessly" also speaks volumes.

Throw ins ffs. Pathetic...

2597~~~
Big sodding woop? On another day that's a goal, again he was only able to atone because of a poor first touch. That's 2 massive errors in one half.

2598~~~
Aye, for a winger playing at RB you would think attacking will his strong point, but it isn't. Luckily Mata has been class, so all he needs to do is defend.

2599~~~
Are we talking about the first goal here? Because when Milner plays the ball, Silva isn't even close to being offside, he's about 3 yards from the offside trap with 5 players playing him onside. And fwiw Valencia was in line with Jones to boot.

2600~~~
He wasn't really good and at fault for the goal but surely got better as the game went on. Still, City attacked down our right for a reason

2601~~~
Honestly, this was a typical Valencia at RB performance, no more, no less. 

He's terrible positionally, but he has enough pace and power to make up for it if it's on his side of the pitch. No excuse for going to sleep for the first goal though, that was a lack of effort as well as a lack of intelligence.

Going forwards, it's the same old also. He could burst past virtually any defender if he wanted to, but doesn't do it enough - I was screaming at him to go for it every time David bloody Silva was standing in front of him. End product was same-ish, although very late on he actually got his head up and picked a very good pullback to Mata, who couldn't quite sort his feet out.

2602~~~
No, im talking about the mistake before the recovery tackle he made when Augero miscontrolled it when he was clear in on goal.

2603~~~
So no midfielders ever parttake in a counter attack, and you question people's grasp of football. You said It yourself that it is a team sport. When Smalling covers wide Carrick covers in the centre. When Herrera covers wide, it is no great concern that Valencia is further up the pitch. I actually believe fotballers are instructed to cover for each other. 

Herrera covered wide down that flank several times, as he should. Fletcher was great at that for instance.

2604~~~
He does a job there but we need to invest in an actual right back this summer andmim pretty confident that we will.

2605~~~
No, because on another day, Valencia still has the pace to get across in time - as he would have done even if the first touch had been good.

2606~~~
Absolute nonsense.

2607~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Right, because on another day, Valencia is slower? He still would have got there regardless of Aguero's touch because... incredibly... Valencia is quicker than Aguero! Amazing right?

2608~~~
No because Valencia doesn't have the ability to stop time. The fact he miscontrols it tells us he got to the ball first?

2609~~~
Forget Rafael.

2610~~~
Erm, Aguero still got to the ball first - the only difference his control would have made was to bring the ball further infield to run directly at goal, but Valencia still would have been able to match his run and get there in more than enough time. This really isn't difficult.

2611~~~
Can't do much when its a 2 on 1 on that flank. Giggs implored Mata to help him out after that.

2612~~~
I don't understand that the same people who (with some justification) would attack Rafael's positioning can't find anything wrong with Valencia's constant disappearing act. 
Twice in the 1st half he did fresh-air swipes in their half allowing dangerous counters to build. Once (which I can remember) he was (as usual) sucked in to the middle of the box allowing Milner an acre to himself to take a shot. (BTW this has happened in every single Valencia RB game ever). He played Aguero onside but then recovered. There was one City counter when he started goalside of Herrera (who lost the ball) but when the shot was taken, Herrera was next to Smalling who made the block, while Valencia hadn't reached the box. 
I didn't see the 1st 30 mins so can't comment on the goal but it seems universally accepted here that he got done in by some movement around him - surprise surprise.

2613~~~
Let's just play your game and pretend Aguero wouldn't have been able to get his shot away before The Flash gets back in time. He's still one on one against Valencia who is on the back foot and in an unfavourable position, even in this scenario Augero has a great chance to find the net.

2614~~~
Since you have a superior understanding of football than others, can you shed light on why top managers play Valencia as RB? or is it Ekeke > (Van Gaal + Fergie)

2615~~~
I suggested it myself

But I didnt know that he has no capacity to learn the basic positioning for the role. Usually players learn, he hasn't.

Sir Alex used him at rightback a couple of times, which is fine. He's a fine backup

2616~~~
When he defends better than he did today in the bigger matches.

I've enjoyed Valencia's general return to form at full back this season, and he's a good option there, but we can do better both offensively and defensively.

His positioning today, and against Arsenal in the FA Cup, highlights that he's still a work in progress at right back.

He had a very good second half today, mind you.

2617~~~
Some terrible shite in here. Tony deserves nothing but praise, has been pretty phenomenal all things considered for last couple of months. Is he the long term solution at right-back? Of course not. But he's there on merit and it's questionable whether there's a better player in that position in the league on current form.

2618~~~
Just watched it again, and its harsh to call that an error. He doesn't drift offside for one thing. He pauses slightly when he reaches a line with Smalling, before seeing Ageuro running, who he decides to track. So he's well aware of the offside line.

As it happens Milner could have played the ball earlier, but didn't. If you watch the replay Milner waits before releasing the ball, which means that Aguero could have been caught offside if Valencia had played the offside trap.

However the point is that Valencia had to make a decision about whether to track Aguero or not <i>before</i> it was too late. He couldn't leave him to run hoping that Milner would delay the pass as he did. Had Milner run onto the ball and passed it early we might have caught Aguero offside, but that would have been luck not judgement.

At the end of the day, in those situations you make a call, track the runner or leave him. He tracked the runner, which is the less elegant option, but the safer one. And certainly not one I would call an obvious error.

2619~~~
Could Aguero's have done a first touch that would have put him through on goal and Valencia wouldn't have been able to do anything about it?

2620~~~
He was never a RB under SAF except for some emergencies- when Rafael was injured ot we were playing Stoke, Smalling/Jones played there not Valencia. Moyes loved subbing Rafael off for Valencia when we were drawing/losing, which simultaneously weakened our attack and defence, and I don't remember it helping us once.

2621~~~
Yes that was terrible. He gave him all the time in the world to line it up, by wandering hopelessly into no man's land for no reason whatsoever. Luckily Milner matched it with an equally terrible attempt which went 95 yards over the bar. 

Often whatever happens in the first half just gets completely forgotten after the final whistle. I see it all the time. He was atrocious in the first 30 minutes but picked up well towards the end of the first half and was definitely good in the second, so it's just been brushed over by most I guess, but ultimately cost us a goal and could easily have been two or more with his defensive lapses. I feel  people are very forgiving of his positional weakness because 'he isn't a natural defender'. But the thing is he is definitely better at full back than he is as an utterly hopeless winger, so he should be judged on his merits in his best position as any other player is.

His physical assets are great for a full back and he keeps possession very well but the fact of the matter is his lack of defensive awareness has, does and will continue to cause us problems and while he does a good job of getting forward and offering support, he is still not exactly an effective attacker most of the time. We have to be in the market in the summer. I'd understand keeping him around for backup (although I'd rather Rafael was as I find him much more enjoyable) but a really good buy there could strengthen us considerably.

Let's not bring out these typical fallacies. What about when Herrera was left out of the team for weeks on end and people were calling for him to play and they were eventually proven right? Does it mean they are bigger geniuses than the manager or whatever? Of course not, it doesn't mean anything.

2622~~~
But Smalling doesn't step forward to play offside until Milner delays the pass, Smalling is in control of the situation, Valencia fails to read the situation and it almost cost us.

2623~~~
Eh? Smalling gets it horribly wrong. He starts to step up but stops when Aguero is still a yard onside and ends up totally flat footed. In no way is Smalling in control there.

2624~~~
He was caught out a couple of times but he's made a snap decision for the Aguero break and he's got it right. He's quickly weighed up the situation and just decides to forget playing offside and just deal with the threat using his pace. Fair enough in my book

2625~~~
Anyone have a gif of that tracking all the way to left back along with the tackle to win a goal kick.

2626~~~
Yep, unless we can get someone like Carvajal, which is highly unlikely, then we just need reliable cover for him, not him to be cover. He's been brilliant and getting better constantly.

2627~~~
No he wouldn't have been through on goal because he was in line with the right edge of the 18 yard box, not central, and was at least 35 yards from goal when he miscontrolled, with Valencia 5 yards from him. 

However Silva was running unmarked through the middle so had Aguero controlled it properly there was a pass on, albeit its hard to say if it would have been an easy pass. Dangerous situation either way.

2628~~~
Augero isn't going to beat Smalling in a foot race and he would've stepped up successfully if Valencia hasn't circled around, the only thing he wasn't in control of was Valencia.

2629~~~
Smalling was flat footed and facing the wrong direction, and Aguero was running from deep. Smalling would not be able to turn around and then, from a standing start, catch up the 3 or 4 yards Aguero would have had on him. You're just clutching at straws.

2630~~~
But if Valencia wasnt in the wrong position he was offside, he wouldn't have needed to! That's the point of playing offside.

2631~~~
Good game from him. He's not been <i>that </i>good that we don't need to replace him with a more natural RB though.

2632~~~
I feel like standards for full backs, overall, have fallen nowadays. Now people expect them to be like wingers going forward whilst just dealing with 1-on-1 situations, defensively. There is less of an appreciation for proper up-and-coming full backs nowadays (Lahm-like full backs) with more focus on attacking wing backs.

I agree. This was a typical Valencia performance. Defensively, he was being dragged around too easily and showed a lack of defensive awareness, but other than the first 25 minutes, he recovered his positions very well with his pace, energy, and strength. This was demonstrated perfectly when he tracked Aguero's run and stopped him from making more out of that chance.

On the ball, he was once again key in helping us keep possession on the right side and linking up with Mata and Herrera. Whenever Milner tried to press him, Valencia maintained possession well, and this created spaces for Mata and Herrera to receive the ball and continue our attacking build-up. He was still a bit too passive going forward, but in this formation and setup, I don't mind it too much, especially since he became more attacking in the second half and put in 1-2 nice deliveries.

In matches against good-quality opposition, I'd rather play a right back who's more defensively reliable than Valencia. We can't keep getting away with Valencia recovering his position all of the time as there will come an instance or two where the opposition will actually punish us for that.

2633~~~
Gary Neville immediately called out the mistake, and if there's one person I'd listen to about fullback defending it's him

2634~~~
His best performance as a right back. Excellent.

2635~~~
Why is he at fault for the first goal? Both him and Smalling tracked their men; Valencia tracks Clichy before Smalling takes over, and he, himself, focuses on Milner. Carrick and Mata simply allow Silva to waltz past them, and Jones is busy ball watching; Blind, too, has a view of Aguero, who's the only City player in the box, so should really call or take charge himself.

As for the offside, who the eff cares? Him and Smalling weren't in sync, but he recovered brilliantly. Nothing came of it, not sure why it's even being discussed.

The Valencia hate makes me sick.

2636~~~
Well Gary calls it how he sees it in the moment, but do watch the replay again before making up your mind. I've seen the replay a bunch of times now and calling it a mistake is harsh. There's a runner coming from deep, Smalling is out of control of the situation and Valencia makes a decision to track the runner. The only reason that Aguero would have been offside is because Milner releases the ball so slowly. If he releases it quickly, Aguero is through, and this whole conversation takes place in the Smalling thread, complaining about his defending.

2637~~~
The Valencia hate here is just <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The 2v1 situation where the ball went out for a goal kick was just excellent. Had Rafael been in that position, I'd have half expected a rash challenge and a penalty.
Some posters here do seem to know better and question Valencia at RB. They definitely seem to know more than LvG.

Even admitting that Valencia had a good game (barring the 1st goal) is beyond them. Somehow I don't see any Young bashing as he definitely was at fault for the second.

2638~~~
This. Last match Herrera and Valencia weren't in sync for that move on the right and the caf said it was because Valencia was daft - does not have a footballing brain etc etc. I remember clearly Valencia making that same run today and Herrera not going for that pass.

People here hate the poor guy so much they are blaming the first goal on him when he had no part in it. (Mata/Carrick should have tracked the run) And the Smalling offside trap excuse is just plain ridiculous. He's not a RB - and Rafael is a much better player but atleast cut the guy some slack.

He's a very good footballer - it's evident if you see how well he plays one touch football - not to mention the energy, continous runs up and down.

2639~~~
I totally agree. And that that first goal was a result of bad defending from several players, not just Valencia who tends to be blamed for everything. I don't see urgent need to replace him as RB. Incredible athlete with a reasonably good technique. Offensively he isn't as good as he used to be, but decent fullbacks who have no trouble with injuries are really rare.

2640~~~
Just seen it now on MOTD - Aguero is about 40 yards away from goal when he first touches the ball and wide on the right hand-side. Valencia is about 5-10 yards away from him. Regardless of Aguero's touch, Valencia is getting to him every single time. There isn't even a question about it.

2641~~~
he had a very good game today....

2642~~~
He had a good second half, was caught out of position too many times in the first. I love how he just bullies players off the ball <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2643~~~
Made ESPN FC's TOTW.  <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TOTW?src=hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/hashtag/TOTW?src=hash</a>

2644~~~
Sometimes on here it seems like he'd have to cure fecking cancer to get even a shred of praise. I can only think of Zabaleta and Clyne this season as better options at RB.

2645~~~
Best game I have seen him play at RB, well done.

2646~~~
Thought he had a very good game,  came in here expecting praise.  What i found was a set of posters bashing him.  Funny the same posters wanted him out for weeks and Rafael instead. Valencia showed great passion today. I am glad he ia doing great. He is a tank, certainly deserves his place as a starting RB.

2647~~~
Had a great game. Both our wingbacks did.

2648~~~
Being up against David Silva is the hardest match a full back can have in the EPL with Hazard and Sanchez. He did respectable, like all the team City were slicing us through left and right and their goal came from the right. 

I was very surprised to see him having such a good game after that though. His defensive statistics weren't far from Blind's even if Blind was more offensively successful. Very good game.

2649~~~
He struggled with Milner/Silva double teaming him at the start of the game. But after Carrick dropped back to cover the channel, Valencia seemed a lot more assured. I suppose that's what you get when Mata is the winger ahead of you.

I still don't think of him as a proper right-back, mind you. But he's getting there.

2650~~~
He is a physical beast. I am confident when he has to defend instinctively or in a 1v1 or whatever. It's just when it comes to positioning/concentration and the mental side of it that he lacks a bit. Was alright against City though, well done.

2651~~~
This is exactly why - there sure are a lot of people on redcafe nowadays who don't know much about football (not aimed at you) to be complaining. Valencia moves forward to overlap/overload the City LB..if a pass doesn't come off when he's overlapping and they counter, of course he'll be out of position. It is standard for the RCB to then cover for the RB who has pushed up to help attack... yet ppl are complaining that he is not there defending and Smalling has to cover <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>. When the RB bombs up it's up to the DM and or CB to cover if we lose possession.

2652~~~
I would definitely take Valencia over signing Clyne but I do hope we sign a natural right back this summer and we will probably have too because it looks like Rafael will be leaving. Maybe a young RB like Fabinho who will have time to get used to the league with Valencia avalible if the new RB has any struggles.

2653~~~
I was pulling my hair out at him last week and the week before but credit where it's due, he was bloody excellent today.

Right up there with Carrick, Fellaini and Blind, and just behind Ander and Young as the best performers on the pitch.

2654~~~
Nobody is complaining that Smalling had to come over and cover for him. People are complaining that Valencia then almost walked back, when he had plenty of time to get back in time to put pressure on the player that ended up going through where Smalling normally would have been.

Likewise, Valencia then almost let Aguero in late in the first half when he kept him on side while Smalling and the other defenders held their lines.

2655~~~
I think people are complaining more about how he'd push forward to press Clichy/whoever was at our right side too early, causing Smalling to go to the right, which required Carrick to go back to fill in for Smalling but for him being unsure about whether to drop back and leave the gap at the hole or keep that filled up but leave space in behind for someone to run through. This is what caused us our initial problems (and the early goal), but later on, we settled, and our shape was much better when Valencia pushed up and left his area. This was why we were also much better in the second half.

2656~~~
that block on Aguero when he was through on goal and had other players alone to pass to them was magnificient.

2657~~~

2658~~~
You can see how most players are surprised how strong and fast a man can be.

2659~~~
Had a great game yesterday and at the moment he's probably the best right back in the Premier League.

2660~~~
At least we can now see how far behind the line he was in the first place after Smalling stepped up. Augero was further out than I thought but better touch and a simple square pass to Silva and its a goal.

2661~~~
That's nothing other than excellent defending. The agendas in this thread are insane.

2662~~~
It's a fantastic recovery for sure but even in that gif you can see how laughably out of position he is in the first place. It's a real weakness, but obviously somehow goes unnoticed for most people. I have no problem saying he had a good game but it's hard not to take issue when people say he was contender for motm or had an amazing game, when he so obviously didn't when taking the first 30 minutes into account. His doziness literally cost us a goal and almost two if Aguero hadn't totally bungled that second touch and played in Silva.

2663~~~
We've now gone from 'we need someone who is better at link up play' (which Valencia is and always has been very good at) to 'he is poor at throw-ins'. Add posters who note every single imperfect bit of action, that happens constantly to every player, usually even more frequently than in Valencia's case and it's really become laughable.

There were people in the matchday thread (skipped through it today - I regret!) who could tell you in which minute he apparently made some mistake that I have to admit after re-watching the game - didn't happen at all!

Good number of posters were hell-bent on slating him since the word go, i don't know if it's the usual service in matchday threads but shame on them. Some hideous abuse. The first goal, which he was to be blamed for among others, only added fuel to the fire. Was great afterwards, especially that recovery and his second half performance for which -surprise surprise- he still got bollocked for by some. Madness.

2664~~~
I actually thought it was good defending to just make a decision to deal with it and not try being clever with the offside. Looking at that video though, he's a bit lucky with Aguero's touch. Really should've seen Silva in acres

2665~~~
There was also that kung fu kick clearance later in the game. Not sure if there's a gif about.

2666~~~
How is he lucky with Aguero's touch when in reality, a better infield touch would only get Aguero's path closer to Valencia's? The moment Aguero got the ball Valencia caught him so quickly he didn't even have an angle for a pass to Silva as well. There's nothing lucky about that. It's just pace and decisiveness.

2667~~~
Not a fan of Val but he grew whith each passing minute. Top defending

2668~~~
The one with his backheel that cleared the ball from under Aguero's head, another goal-saving tackle. He produced two most spectacular and last moment bits of defending since that McNair goal-line clearance. Not bad for a winger playing right-back, is it?

2669~~~
Played well yesterday for the most part, but was guilty of schoolboy defending when he played Aguero onside.

A different day and that's another game changing chance at goal he would of been guilty of, you cant afford that at this level, you cant have your defence giving up chances like that on a regular basis.

2670~~~
And Blind got blitzed for pace naively early on which Navas should have capitalized on and Smalling went for a surging run, losing the ball still in our half with City having more men attacking than we at the back and Jones played a hospital ball to De Gea and Young got exposed for their 2nd goal. Sure you'd find other blunders. That's whole defence + Young with critical mistakes in the very same game.

Everyone makes defensive mistakes and you got on with it but somehow can't when it comes to him. 'you can't have defence giving up chances' should read you 'can't have Valencia as a RB because he's prone to make the odd mistake' at least be honest about it.

2671~~~
I thought the same yesterday, but Aguero should've done better with that and he and Silva know it. Once he closed the space down he did really well though.

2672~~~
its no secret he has to improve his positioning and I think he is improving despite that mistake yesterday! He had a good game overall

2673~~~
Blind's positioning was worse yesterday, a lot worse and I don't see anything in his thread.

2674~~~
There are clearly several posts highlighting how he got caught out twice in the opening minutes by Navas.

2675~~~
Say Ashley Young recovered from his mistake for their second goal and somehow managed to get back and block the cross with a sliding tackle. Do you lambast him or praise him for getting the job done, even if he does that later than we'd have liked? You praise him because ultimately he does his job. Same should apply to Valencia even if you are positive it was his mistake with the offside trap. He wasn't lucky but he recovered, made a decision and got the job done better than any of us thought he could at the time.

Blind was lucky because he didn't atone for his error at all but had De Gea behind him, Jones was lucky with the backpass as De Gea was sharp and Smalling was lucky others got him out of jail. Which is the aim of this sport. We made 5 bad mistakes in the first half but others or the same player himself atoned for the error on 4 occasions. You will make mistakes but you have to minimalize them and to our credit, we did in the second half.

2676~~~
Till the very moment Aguero gets the ball, Valencia waits if he's going to play Silva and is more or less in line. Say Aguero touches the ball infield or keeps it closer to his feet, Valencia would have been at him in a blink of an eye instead pursuing him when he saw Aguero bearing down on goal. It would take a marvelous chip pass by Aguero to beat Valencia and it would have to be played literally the second he received the ball. 

It (gif) actually looks better each time you could argue that even if Aguero lobs it to Silva, Valencia being then midway in between them would fancy his chances to catch Silva who is way further from goal than Valencia at that point.

2677~~~
It wouldn't take a perfect chipped pass at all because Silva has 15 yards of space but we'll agree to disagree.

2678~~~
Its a 2 on 1, no matter how you want to put it if the right decision is made then Valencia has no chance, as with any other player in the world.

2679~~~
No, them doing the same thing does not excuse him from doing it.
In case you didnt realise, this is the Antonio Valencia thread, opinions about Smalling, Jones and Blind will be being discussed in their respective threads.

2680~~~
The positives in Valencia's game yesterday outweighed the negatives massively.

2681~~~
Probably down to the fact that people consider him and his future as a central midfielder. It isn't necessarily a positive on Valencia to say Blind was at a similar level, when Valencia is fighting for that RB spot in particular and should be judged whether or not he can do that job for us at the top level.

Blind can make a mistake or two and people will still realize that he's just filling in because Shaw isn't available. It is like if Herrera played LW for a game because all our options were injured, he'd not be expected and compared to Hazard/Sanchez/Silva - we'd all praise him for doing an alright job.

I think Valencia was very good yesterday overall though. Terrible defending in that scenario but I agree with the thesis that defenders(all players) will make mistakes and recovery is a lot more important than what most people wants to admit.

All defenders will make small errors here and there, the way they recover from it is what is truly important.

Clichy made a positional mistake and then he didn't make up for it by in any way disturbing Fellaini's finish and Clichy has been one of the leagues best LB this year more or less.

I do see the point of why people are targeting Valencia though, we have a hard time upgrading our positions considering Di Maria and Mata are used wide and Rooney is a certain starter for us.

People always talk about making upgrades and the RB spot has caught a lot of attention. Not because Valencia is bad but because we have new fancy signings already in most positions.

2682~~~
I have said he played well apart from that.

Its there in black and white.

What I have said is true is well, you cannot give up those kinds of chances regularly, once in blue moon every player is going to slip up, not step up, miss a header, lose his man or whatever, you simply cannot have it have it happening nearly every game.
In Valencias case, its because he isnt a fullback, nothing is going to change that, in the others case its because they are either a fill in player (Blind, same problem as Valenica not a dedicated fullback) or developing (Jones and Smalling).

Fullback is just as specialized position as anywhere else on the pitch, yes you can have players fill in, but the difference between a dedicated rightback and a converted/fill in player is night and day.

2683~~~
It was very poor to get so out of sync with the rest of the back 4, but what a bonus having such blistering pace in the team. It wasn't the first time he saved our skin and it wont be the last. In the absence of us somehow finding the best RB in the league from somewhere I'm happy with him there.

2684~~~
I always sympathize with defenders. Apart from keeping your concentration levels in tact you play your heart out, run like mad for the whole game chasing opposite players, risking an injury every time you slide in at a full pelt then one mistake creeps in and you're the villain. Gks can have it even worse. Striker will have a stinker for 90 minutes, then scores a fecking tap and he's a hero.

2685~~~
Or that moment when he waltzed through Samir Nasri like he wasn't even there. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2686~~~
Spot on! We saw it with Kompany and Demichilis as well. Actually, that's how we got our third goal. Demichilis got pulled out to the right back spot, and Mata dropped into that space. Ideally, Toure would have had to fill in for Demichilis.

2687~~~
The funny thing is Blind has played as a LB far more often than Valencia has at RB. Not just in the world cup but before at Ajax and when he went on loan there before his ajax first team debut. It was on his return to Ajax that De Boer made him a DM iirc.

People in here who slate Valencia are for the msot part the same ones who disliked him as our RW even when he was ace because he displaced Nani. LvG has found a good balance. TO allow Mata to thrive on the right Valencia is more suitable than Rafael. The triangles, Valencia, Herrera an Mata play are spellbinding at times. Our left side is pace )AY) and dominating brute force (MaFel) our right is one-touch football.

2688~~~
As pointe out above, this is Valencia' first season as an actual RB unlike Blind who's played that position before.

Besides, I don't see a future for Blind as a CM. He's definitely not a #6 and both Fellaini and Herrera are better #8's. He's an LB for me, be it first choice or as a cover for Shaw.

2689~~~
can't believe how more brainless player can be. absolute dogshite going forward, creativity fecking zero. scared to hell to make anything but a pass backwords. Bring on Rafael

2690~~~
Want to see the goal again to see where Valencia is. Is he the one Fabregas gets past to make the pass at the start?

2691~~~
I think he's been one of our best players today, there's so much disagreement in the each of player threads so far

2692~~~
I thought he was fine in the first half, he is economical with the ball but had some good moments and has discipline.

2693~~~
Okay there's the goal again. He's ball watching. He isnt tackling Fabregas, he isnt tracking his winger Hazard. He's caught between the two and does nothing in that move

2694~~~
He was our best player.

2695~~~
He's dallying on the ball, hasn't worked a single decent chance into the box and just let Hazard go past him and didn't do anything to get back. But yeah, best player.

2696~~~
He ran up and down the line a couple of times.. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2697~~~
Partly responsible for the goal but other than that has been superb. Patrolling the whole right flank on his own basically. Allowing Mata to roam without sacrificing our right flank.

Now if only he could put in a decent cross or two to Falcao..

2698~~~
You're getting a bit boring. The goal wasn't remotely his fault.

2699~~~
So lump him in with the other 9 who haven't created anything. Has Mata created anything? Has Rooney?

2700~~~
He was not at fault for the goal (though I have no idea who he was marking, he was just ambling around) but he's to blame for the DDG handball situation. He just threw himself in front of his own keeper, what on earth could he be thinking?

2701~~~
Apart from his winger scoring on his side, as he does nothing

2702~~~
Herrera was on Hazard if i recall. Keep trying.

2703~~~
Hes been excellent. Im actually at a loss that people are criticising him today, I expected even his harshest critics to be holding their hands up and saying well done. 

Do people realise that it's absolutely not his job to risk dribbling past players? If he's dispossed trying to beat a man we're completely screwed. It's just not up to him to do unless other players are ready to cover him, which is pretty much never.

2704~~~
Very good first half

2705~~~
Has anyone said Mata is our best player today? Or Rooney? If they have, please point me in their direction.

2706~~~
He hasn't had a lot of help on that side to be fair. The left wing we've continued with that triangle (Young, Fellaini and Blind switched for Shaw), but on the right Herrera isn't there as an option because he's playing the holding role. Mata naturally drifts inside to influence the play and exploit the space Chelsea are giving us by dropping deep which means Tony often has two men to take on.

2707~~~
He should've closed down the space between Fabregas and Hazard initially. Rooney had a go at him after the goal.

2708~~~
Just watched it again. He could've done better at closing down space, but it was morso a miscommunication between Val, Smalling, and Herrera.

2709~~~
Very similar to what happened for the first goal against City.

2710~~~
Hazard is the left winger. Valencia is the right back.

Valencia isn't in the correct position when Fabregas turns and passes, and he cant get back into the right position to track his winger

If he was in the correct position in the first place, a CM doesnt need to track the left winger. Its Oscar that Ander might have been able to do better with, Hazard is all on Valencia

2711~~~
No but why is our right back derided for not creating chances when our attackers haven't done it either. He's playing the right flank on his own. He gets criticised for following Hazard and not keeping his position and now es criticised for not following Hazard ino the middle while Hererra watchable him run past him. Much like he did with Silva last week.

2712~~~
Two weeks running Herrea has just let players run away from him in the centre of the pitch. The nuetrals have picked it up I wonder why people here can't.

2713~~~
Which suggests there's a bit of miscommunication going on. Hazard was in midfield with Herrera on him.

2714~~~
He's being criticized because he has had the ball in semi-dangerous areas many times and does nothing except go back or pass it infield. He doesn't have to beat his man but he isn't even putting in any crosses from those deeper positions. Fullbacks are as important to attacks as anyone imo, the best cross into the ball has been from Luke Shaw. 

And he will be criticized for not following runners because that is also part of a full backs job. They have to see danger as they are looking across the line and have the defensive awareness to cover.

2715~~~
I felt he faded a bit in the second half but a decent all round performance.

2716~~~
On the ball I won't talk about because it does bad things to my blood pressure.
Off the ball defending today he was better, but
1. The whole de Gea handball thing - what was he thinking????
2. Hazard had gone infield for the goal so he can't be blamed much, but he was doing absolutely nothing wandering about when players were streaming past on either side of him.

2717~~~
I thought he was mostly okay aside from the goal and the miscommunication with De Gea. He did make a couple of good tackles like normal

2718~~~
He was very good today - actually used his pace well.

2719~~~
Ridiculous. 

He's a RB and did his job excellently. No more to it.

2720~~~
I dont understand the hate he gets at all, Very good touch and control, good passes, very strong, very disciplined, runs all day long. Really a dream player for a team

I used to hate him for last 2 years when he was supposed to be a winger, as he totally lost his attacking instinct, but now hes a fullback, and thats not his main job anymore, and he usually delivers a 7/10 performance in almost very match

2721~~~
He absolutely did not.

2722~~~
He most definitely did. Absolutely not at fault for the goal.

Agenda posting at it's finest.

2723~~~
He's partly at fault, not entirely.

Valencia is one of those players, youll only see how much better you could have when you actually finally get somebody better.

He's neat and tidy, strong and fast, that's it.

He wouldn't or shouldn't be a starting RB for a team that wants to be challenging for the title and champions league. It's really not a surprise that that is a position Van Gaal seemingly can't wait to improve.

2724~~~
It feels like every other goal we concede is due to some sort of error from this guy.. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2725~~~
I don't understand how he is remotely at fault for this goal though... I mean, he could have maybe closed down Fabregas a bit faster, but that's hardly the biggest crime.

2726~~~
He's not at fault for the goal. Defensively he does his job very well, probably better than most RB's in the league. Ivanovic got destroyed by Shaw today for instance.

Could do better going forward but doesn't help him that he doesn't have an actual winger next to him.

I'd say he's the kind of RB people will appreciate once we sign a RB in the summer and realise he's not better than Valencia after all. People still judge him as a winger which is the main problem. Forget he ever played as a winger for us and he starts to look like an excellent RB.

2727~~~
First of all he failed to push Fabregas to the side of the pitch, rather then inviting him into the centre. He also barely broke a sweat to catch up with Hazard.. 

I hope he's stuck in traffic for the Everton -game just so Rafael could get a chance <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2728~~~
Valencia getting blamed again... We got completely outplayed for their goal. Sometimes you have to just take sit back and applaud Oscar and Hazard, I don't think anyone can be blamed.

2729~~~
I disagree, but let's move on.

2730~~~
Thought he was good today overall. Varied up his attacking play a bit more than usual coming inside and I think picked out more forward passes, although memory could be failing me. A better defender maybe would have been more switched on to the danger of Hazard running in behind, but it's a stretch to say he was the main one at fault.

2731~~~
He was nowhere near Hazard. It was Hererra who let him run away from him.

2732~~~
May as well start blaming him for HIV, bird flu, the plague... Think his defending allowed that tsunami to take out South East Asia too...

2733~~~
I think he should have seen the danger a bit earlier tbh, Herrera is def the most culpable, but looking head on, he should have seen that coming, and he reacted way too late to the situation.

2734~~~
Mata is with Fabregas. Valencia is in no man's land.

2735~~~
If he had been in charge of defending that he would have been trying to stop a storm in Florida while the tsunami was eating up Indonesia.

2736~~~
He was on the touch line positioning himself for a pass from Smalling. There was a still of when he played the pass to Falcao earlier on Sky. Not one of the people on the panel mentioned Valencia. People here are stretching to put any blame on him for this while absolving the player who was actually closest to Hazard.

2737~~~
The utter desperation to blame Valencia for everything is getting a bit tedious.

2738~~~
The difference between overrating Herrera and underrating Valencia is ridiculous. Bet if he was a likeable Spanish guy, people would praise him.

2739~~~
Thats 5 seconds before Fabregas gets the ball. He's taken it, gone past mata and passed the ball and Valencia hasnt moved

2740~~~
Can he learn how to take a throw in.

2741~~~
It is pretty poor isn't it. He's on the edge every time for it being a foul throw.

2742~~~
he was average at best, once again showed he is one way player, knowing only some moves unable to improvize or play with his left foot, provide more inventive passing to the middle.. really looks like lacks brain completely and see only 10 yards around him. Scared to shit to make some half risky pass. His solidity wasn't just enough in a game where we needed to create chances..

#Bringbackrafa

2743~~~
Why isn't LVG seeing all that is wrong with Valencia? It's getting silly that he seems to take some kind of blame every week.

He was very solid again today, I would go as far to say he has been one of the best right backs in the PL in 2015

2744~~~
So Fabregas has gone past Mata and Hazard has gone past Herrera and the goal is Valencia's fault? You can't expect to be taken seriously here.

2745~~~
Theres no danger from Fabregas going past Mata on the halfway line if your right back is at right back. 

When he's stuck to the spot and Fabregas finds a pass to Oscar, thats when its trouble.

If Fabregas runs the ball down the line, then Valencia has to eventually confront him and block crossing oppertunities. There is absolutely no need to try and confront him that far forward, and then fail to do so, and then fail to recover your position. He took himself out of the move completely by being in the wrong position to start with

2746~~~
You are talking absolute nonsense mate.


Hazard is only Valencia's man when he's working the right channel. We don't man mark wingers, he was central and he was Herrera's responsibility.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/IIyDhs2.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/IIyDhs2.png"/>

<b>That's Hazard next to the referee and Valencia in the correct space to stop Fabregas attacking down the line. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/6VsJauo.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/6VsJauo.png"/> 

That's Herrera by the ref inexplicably chasing the ball towards Oscar who now recieves it from Fabregas. In this situation Carrick or Blind would be keeping goals side of and tracking the runner, Hazard. 


<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/fizf0Cd.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/fizf0Cd.png"/> 

You can see here that Herrera made completely the wrong decision, running towards a player with two men covering him already, Smalling closed him down while McNair had him covered on his left. As this is barely a few seconds later Valencia is still in position at right back, there's no way he is expected to fall back into that space, it's Herrera's job to track Hazard. 


<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GC3UXYuyr6o?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
</b>
Here's the video to see how fast it plays out. Valencia does try to cover for Herrera but as he was in the correct position to contain Hazard, he can't get back in time. 


Long and the short of it, Herrera chased the ball rather than tracking the player. Put simply, Herrera is not a defensive midfielder and if we had Carrick or Blind fit we most likely would not have conceded that goal. 

feck all to do with Valencia.

2747~~~
Smalling should have seen Hazzard run of Herrera and adjusted quicker. Valencia was not to blame. That's the way we play with our full backs if the goal had been with the Chelsea defence then yes you would be questioning the full back as they play deeper and flatter.

2748~~~
A cross of Valencia and Rafael would make an ideal RB. However, you do not find many of them these days, I guess.

2749~~~
Goal today not his fault but he's a failed, gutless winger playing right back. Need investment in that department.

2750~~~
Valencia's stats yesterday:

68/70 passes. 97.1%
0/2 crosses. 
3/5 take ons
3/5 tackles
3 interceptions
6 ball recoveries. 

That's a good day for a fullback.

2751~~~
Are you saying it was his fault we didn't create enough?

2752~~~
Good video and really illustrates Valencia's lack of defensive awareness. He made no attempt to get back when the ball was played to Oscar. By the time he tried to react to Oscar playing Hazard through it was too late. Shaw's position is a great example of where a full back should be.

That is now two weeks in a row when the crucial first goal in a big game came down a great big gaping hole in the right side of defence. Saying "he was nowhere near it. It had nothing to do with him" is nonsense. A back 4 defends zonally. He should be there. He has got zero defensive instincts.

2753~~~
Seriously?

Shaw is where he is because he's on the opposite side of the pitch a mile away from the action and he's holding the defensive line. 

Valencia is where he is because he had to step up out of the defensive line to close Fabregas' space down. 

It's Herrera who fecks up. It really is that simple. People have such trouble being objective about Valencia because he is a cowardly shit on a stick winger. He just so happens to be a solid right back.

2754~~~
Valencia wasn't at fault for the goal but nor was he doing anything useful - he was not in a position to block Hazard (as we saw) nor was he covering Fabregas properly (neither when Oscar or Hazard had the ball). He was, as he has been prone to doing for a while now, ambling around.

I also think the definition of solid RB has changed  while I was not looking - Brown was a solid RB, Ivanovic on the same pitch as Valencia today is a solid RB (and he was often 2v1 too in the 1st half). Where being able to tackle or intercept doesn't mean being out of position. He's an athletic RB who can charge into and out of position and barge people off the ball, but he's not a solid RB.

2755~~~
Where was the danger? Allowing Fabregas to move down the wing or leaving Smalling as the only player defensively on the right side of defence?

The key to the full back role is sense danger and to be "on the cover". Herrera could have done better but leaving a gaping hole in defence like that is so dangerous.

Maybe the full back role has changed and leaving huge gaps is now accepted but if you are a defensive player you need to be able to see where the threat is. Valencia just doesn't.

2756~~~
Yeah, I'd agree with that. Although not doing anything useful makes you apart of that problem. He was too wide, leaving a huge gap between him and Smalling and once Fabregas played the ball infield to Oscar he hardly moved to try and cover that gap. Sure Ander, Smalling and whoever could and should have done better as well but it is no excuse for Valencia's consistent lack of awareness and positioning. 

With the play in front of him he is quite good, he can handle 1v1s as he has the strength and pace to deal with anyone and he is a decent tackler. When it comes to runs in behind and watching the play behind you he is near clueless. He doesn't know how to position himself for this and its why you often see him like in this incident turn around and doddle for a couple of seconds until he reacts to the danger. He is fast so he can make up for it sometimes but other times it is too late. He is pretty much the complete opposite of Blind.

2757~~~
So posters here shall keep blaming Valencia for every freaking game. LvG playing him every match certainly gives you a fair idea as to who he rates higher. Unless there are some geniuses here who think they definitely know more than LvG. The over rating of Rafael and the underrating of Valencia is getting more tedious day by day. On current form Valencia is way more dependable than Rafael.

2758~~~
Couldn't agree more.

I started this thread to mock him this season and had been on his back for the previous two seasons for being a cowardly, inefficient and quite frankly, shite, winger. But I try to be as objective as I can when it comes to player performances and I've got a bit sick of having to defend him against a selection of posters that can't see past the fact he isn't a winger anymore and isn't expected to be taking risks and galavanting off to the byline at every opertunity.

He's been defensively solid for a good few months now but for an error here and there and the majority haven't lead to a goal despite what critics will have you think. If you forensically studied the likes of Ivanovic, Zabeleta, Clyne, hell even Lahm, Jordi Alba or Carvajal with the same tenacity you'd be able to castigate them every other game too. 


Van Gaal is picking him for a reason and it's working as all the statistics show. If he decides there is someone better than him this summer then so be it but the butt hurt Rafael fans need to get a grip and move on. Either he's not right for Van Gaal and he's gone or he's not right for Van Gaal yet and they're working on it and he'll be back when he finally gets it.

2759~~~
I can't see how he was to blame for the goal.

However, I wish he'd learn to fecking cross the ball. I mean it's hardly much to ask for from a guy that's been a winger most of his career. We desperately need a right back with a wicked cross on him. Would be such a huge addition.

2760~~~
I am a big Rafael fan but I thought Valencia was fine. His first touch is really underrated too. Is always immaculate.

2761~~~
Thought this was one of his better games today, it was nice to see him actually step forward with the ball for once and use that strength and pace to take players on. He still just seems like he's unable to read the game though.

The mix up with De Gea for hand ball was his fault, he jumped in front of DDG

I feel a lot of the blame heading AV's way is unfair because the goal wasn't directly his fault, but an intelligent footballer would've seen the passage of play and recognised the danger. He didn't understand the build up or that when Smalling pressed Oscar there was a massive space in behind him that Hazard was running into, he just really didn't seem to do anything.

At one point Herrera played a poor, short ball to Valencia which Chelsea intercepted, it was clearly short and wasn't going to reach AV but he just stood there on the sideline waiting for it, he didn't step back into position nor did he step forward to challenge for it, he couldn't read it.

Lack of footballing intelligence is my biggest gripe with him. Things might not directly be his fault but he doesn't do anything to help matters, after all its a team game and in this system you need to rely on others.

2762~~~
I thought he was OK defensively but people are definitely right to point out the lack of positional awareness. He's just not a natural right back and when the ball gets played quickly around him we struggles with seeing the danger. He's done well enough but we need a new RB clearly if LvG doesn't rate Rafael. 

It's also interesting to note that Monreal's goal in the FA cup, Aguero's first goal and now Hazard's goal came down his side. Yet there are some who insist that Valencia had zero fault in all these. Some even blamed Jones for his back pass in the Arsenal game. If there's an agenda as some people say, it's probably pro Valencia if anything.

2763~~~
Thought he pretty much nullified Hazzard and Jose moved him infield as a consequence. The amount of stick he gets is unwarranted as he keeps a favourite out. But the reality is he becoming the best right back in the league under LVG.

2764~~~
Best RB in the league, really??

2765~~~
The main thing he does so fricking well, and it can't be underestimated how important it is to Van Gaal's system, is offer an "out" to our defenders and midfielders. In fact I'm certain it's the edge he has over Rafael in Van Gaal's eyes right now. 

As you say, his first touch is immaculate and his holding of the ball is the footballing equivalent of a dog with lock jaw. If a defender or midfielder on his side of the pitch is under pressure you can guarantee that he will be making himself available to them and it doesn't matter how difficult the pass is he will use one touch to kill it and hold on to it until he can find a safe pass. There's no way in hell Rafael can match him on that and when you're playing in Van Gaal's system and these players have the ball it's essential that they don't lose it because the team isn't in shape to defend.

2766~~~
I wish he'd dribble a lot more though. Evra was brilliant in how because of him we could be defending one moment and be on the counter moments later. We know he has the ability to that but seems to prefer playing it safe.

2767~~~
Agree with all that and that Valencia has no blame on him for the goal. Yesterday was different in that we retained the left hand side triangle of Fellaini, Young and Shaw (coming in for Blind), but the usual right hand side triangle wasn't there as Herrera played DM and Mata drifts inside more than Young anyway because he's an attacking midfielder playing wide rather than a natural winger. Neville also noted how deep Chelsea were defending particularly in the first half which meant there was plenty of space for Mata in front of the penalty area to try and influence play and that in turn led to Valencia being quite often 2 vs. 1. He got a bit more help out there when Januzaj came on but unfortunately the kid had a poor game.

2768~~~
Who else has the skill of Valencia? I've been really impressed by Valencia at right back and he is getting better each month. Ivanovic is the best currently then either Coleman or Zabaletta (who Valencia has had a better season than both) or Clyne and imho Valencia is already an upgrade of Clyne.

2769~~~
Valencia has found his form again after that dreadful injury. It took time and he has carried a lot of criticism sometimes warranted but most often not. He has been especially on top of his game in the last few matches. A top player and becoming much more the finished article.

2770~~~
Don't see how that was Valencia's fault. He was covering the line to make sure Fabregas does not run off him. Herrera should have tracked Hazard better. But overall, I am very satisfied with everyone's performance. Falcao clearly is not the answer for us as a CF, apart from that everyone did well. Oh, Smalling should learn how to control a back pass. He over hits it so often it's ridiculous.

2771~~~
I don't understand. He was player of the season the year after his injury. That has had nothing to do with his drop in form. This is a player who's gone from one of best wingers in the league to a full back who has been outshone going forward by whoever is playing on the flank opposite (Shaw yesterday now). I'm not sure what the finished article is meant to be.

2772~~~
It's surprising how many times you have to remind people of this. You're right that it's nothing to do with that leg break at all, just a combination of limited technique which allowed defenders to work him out plus a spectacular dip in confidence and self belief I think.

2773~~~
The irony of bringing up Smalling over hitting back passes in a Valencia thread. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It was Herrera's mistake not to foul Hazard when he had the run on him, Herrera was never keeping up with Hazard in a foot face though. My gripe, as I had mentioned previously is a switched on full back would've had the intelligence to read the progression of the game. Smalling rightly stepped up to challenge Oscar leaving a gaping hole on the right hand side, the only immediate danger was Hazard who was running directly at that space. Blind, Shaw and probably Rafael would've all noticed this and tucked in.

2774~~~
The problem started because Falcao wasn't strong enough to hold Terry off. Valencia was in a position to give Smalling a passing option as we were in possession. We lost it and from that point there is nothing Valencia can do about it. You're talking shite.

2775~~~
Ivanovic got tortured yesterday afternoon despite having the benefit of playing in a team camped in their penalty box.

2776~~~
Along with Shaw he was our best player.

2777~~~
The agenda posting on here really is staggering at times. Valencia has many positive points. Along with his pace and athleticism he is excellent at retaining possession which is absolutely key for Van Gaal's United. His end product is poor but he overlaps well and creates space and options for Mata and Herrera inside.

But those that that defend him from the "he never takes anyone on and his crossing is crap" brigade seem oblivious to his faults. He has terrible defensive instincts. My issue with him is that at a club like United, your first choice right back cannot be such a defensive weak link.

Against poor teams where United dominate it may not matter but in big games against better teams they will exploit the gaping holes he leaves due to poor positioning. The first goal in these big games is crucial and in recent games against the rest of the top 4, the first goal was conceded through a gaping hole in the right side of defence. That is now 3 from the last 3.

Yet he is "solid defensively"?

2778~~~
You can't just say it came down that side so it was his fault. Both have come from players running off Herrera in central areas. I'm not sure what the three were. Unless you're counting the cup game I suppose. Liverpool's goal came from the other side when we played them. As did City's second but we don't have endless discussions about the position of our left back.

2779~~~
Monreal vs Arsenal was the third.

It's not "the goal came down the right so it's his fault". In all 3 cases a player wandered in on the right side of the box and had so much time to do whatever they wanted.

He's the right back in a back 4 that defends zonally. In my time watching United I've never seen another right back who leaves such yawning gaps in defence.

2780~~~
Heh. Poster comes into thread accusing others of having an agenda. Proceeds to blame a player for a goal conceded which had absolutely nothing to do with him. Classic.

2781~~~
Seeing a trend now. After every freaking game there are about 5 posters (not naming them) claiming Valencia being bad and needs to be flogged. Well apart from Valencia, we really do not have a choice currently (seeing that LvG does not rate Rafael although him being fit). And I guess before the end of the season, LvG does not want to tinker too much with the current 11.

2782~~~
I'll assume it was my post you are referring to. Which goal had nothing to do with him?

2783~~~
I don't blame him for any of the goals - its more down to a miscommunication between several players of who is marking who. The anti-Valencia agenda is quite strong here though. Many think Rafa should be starting and each week, and go match day shopping for potential Valencia mistakes to reinforce their views.

2784~~~
Well we only conceded one. So it would be that one.

I try to avoid scapegoating when we concede a goal without any really obvious defensive error but if we really had to blame one United player for Chelsea's goal then it would obviously be Hererra. Nobody else even partly culpable. Unless, of course, you've got an underlying agenda...

It was a good goal, though, and not a very bad error. So don't see the point of scapegoating anyone tbh.

2785~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
In an MEN article:

2786~~~
Im fully with the MEN in regards to Valencia's limitations.

2787~~~
Both he and Ander are at fault for the goal. But Valencia had the entire passage of play ahead of him and could clearly see Hazard bursting past Ander and yet did nothing to close him down. This lack of defensive awareness will cost us a title if we continue to stick with him in defence.

2788~~~
What Valencia does, he mostly does pretty well. I just find him to be an incredibly one dimensional and limited player. His one footedness is an example - how many years has he had as a professional footballer, and not been able to just learn how to use his left foot from time to time? There are so many occasions every single game I see where he has the ball and could make a great pass if he used his left foot, but he inevitably doesnt.

Like I said, what he does do, he does pretty well, I would just prefer someone like Rafael who in my opinion is capable of doing a lot more.

2789~~~
It's actually uncanny how similar Hazard's goal is similar to Aguero's first goal last week.  Both times a midfielder failed to track a run and Valencia gets blame from some on here.  Mata stopped tracking Silva and this week Herrera lost Hazard.  Could Valencia be blamed?  Possibly, because I'm assuming that part of his instruction from LvG is to cover for them.  But in no way can you honestly say he was beaten or drawn away from where he was supposed to be.  It's telling that he stopped running out of frustration at seeing Hazard unmarked running into the box.

It's interesting to note how both Mata and Herrera were on the bench for the greater part of the season, undoubtedly due to their lack of defensive discipline since they are clearly 2 of the more creative players we have.  However given our recent form, having them both on the field has produced results but it does come at a risk because they can tend to switch off.

2790~~~
This - AV was wide to give his usual outball to our defence/midfield. The fact that a teammate turned it over easily left him out fo the equation. Someone should have fouled Hazard and took a yellow.

2791~~~
Valencia is an interesting one, I was never a big fan of him as a winger as he lacks flair, I was always in the Nani camp. However as a RB I think he's fine up to a point, he's very solid and as <a class="username" data-user="44029, @Pexbo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44029/">@Pexbo</a> says, he offers a good out ball and possession retention.

The big issue is in our current system the fullbacks need to provide a threat in attack, you could say this of the modern fullback in general but when you use inverted wingers then that overlap needs to provide penetration and a good final ball, Valencia has been seriously lacking in the latter for some time now, and it's highlighted when when compared to the chances Blind and Shaw have created from the LB position in the last 3 games.

2792~~~
See I'm not convinced that in this system overlapping is so important from the fullback. 

This system has an additional midfielder operating with the wide players. So rather than the classic partnership of fullback and winger it's more about the triangle of Fullback - Midfielder - Wide Man. Valencia - Herrera - Mata, Blind - Fellaini - Young. 

With Herrera and Mata not being as good as defensively as Fellaini and Young, I think Van Gaal has Valencia really choosing when to overlap wisely. They create space for each other by short passing and moving and it's generally Herrera's role to make the runs which create space for Mata.

2793~~~
Probably has been this season. Ivanovic is incredibly overrated because he scores a few goals, zabaleta has been poor and there is nobody else really. Clyne is pretty good but nothing better then valencia this season who has been at a pretty good level all year.

2794~~~
Clyne's reputation has been heavily boosted by playing in a defensive Southampton side that has Wanayama and Schneiderlin offering a lot of protection to the back four.

2795~~~
*Points out the error of a player that are clear as day* cry AGENDA!!!

2796~~~
It's been explained numerous times why it wasn't his fault by numerous people. It's only the 4 or 5 who have an agenda against him that are actually blaming him.

2797~~~
And its been explained numerous times that a good right back could've done a hell of a lot better. It isn't '4 or 5' people, theres a heck of a lot of people here who don't rate Valencia, just check out the what players we need next season thread, members like yourself seem hellbent on absolving him of any blame in the last 6/7 games, that's more of an agenda than anything.

As I've said a couple of times here I wouldn't directly blame Valencia for the goal yesterday but he could've done so much more to prevent it. When the ball was played to Oscar Smalling correctly stepped up to stop him turning which left a gaping hole between our right back and our centre back, after Hazard had broken away from Herrera the only dangerous ball on at that time was to Hazard who was bursting into that gaping hole. At no point did Valencia read this danger and tuck in to prevent it, something an intelligent fullback would've done. Its this lack of footballing intelligence and failure to read the progression of an attack that costs a team set up in the way we are, we rely on players knowing their roles and for everyone to work as a team.

There was another prime example of this when Herrera played a poor, short ball to Valencia that was never going to reach him, he could've either stepped back into position to prevent the counter attack or he could've stepped forward to challenge Fabregas (who intercepted the pass), he did neither, he just sat on the sideline waiting for the ball because he struggles to read the game.

2798~~~
I've said myself I'd happily take a new right back in the summer if Van Gaal identifies an upgrade but it's got to be a top quality player who can grow to be one of the best in the world. Otherwise I'd stick with Valencia and keep scouting.

I just find it a bit tiresome that a few posters can't be objective about him. They're either so scarred by Valencia the winger or frustrated that one of their favourites in Rafael can't get ahead of him that they take great pleasure out of blaming him for every goal we concede and ignore all the good stuff he does for us. 

I've said a million times now, he's one of my least favourite players at the club but I'm not letting that get in the way of seeing what he actually brings to the side and I'm not going to paint him to be worse than he is because I want to be proven right that he's a coward when it comes to attacking. It just so happens that that conservative nature has made him a real asset at right back. 

Van Gaal keeps playing him there so I'm happy enough and if he finds an upgrade in the summer, excellent. If certain posters who have it in for him want to keep trying to lump the blame on him for every goal that we concede so be it but myself and a few others will continue to call them out on it.

2799~~~
End of discussion. He did nothing even though he could see everything unfolding in his field of vision.

2800~~~
Which is still bollocks. He's in the correct position to stop Fabregas progressing down the line, if he's not there Fabregas has acres of space. 

It goes to Oscar and Hazard is already moving into that space behind Valencia. It's Herrera's responsibility to track Hazard and defend that space if Valencia has to step up and press Fabregas. 

There is absolutely no time whatsoever for Valencia to spot that Herrera has made a huge error in chasing the ball rather than tracking his man. It's split seconds. Impossible.

2801~~~
I don't get how some rate him so highly, I can understand defending him but its bizzare to read him as one of the best. 

He's an incredibly limited player who can follow the simple instructions he's given for this system. He doesn't offer an attacking threat and his only defensive skill is to shoulder players off the ball. We do compensate well for him though as Smalling is aware that he needs to cover, however, I question why we need to cover for a RB who offers only a steady out ball.

2802~~~
If you're absolutely determined to find fault a fullback, it's easy. Every goal that is scored from any position to his side of the penalty spot can be blamed on him. And it seems that some people really are absolutely determined to find fault in Valencia. Which is a bit sad but there you go. 

Back in the real world, when midfielders don't track runs we will concede goals and there's nothing our defenders can do about that. Mata and Herrera have been great, so it's churlish to point fingers but seeings as some people on here are absolutely determined to point fingers (see above) they make themselves look like mugs when they point those fingers in the wrong direction.

2803~~~
<a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a>, you're probably finding it quite comical seeing me sick of defending Valencia considering it used to be you defending him from my rants.

2804~~~
Valencia gets so much criticism on this forum <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He wasn't brilliant against Chelsea, but some are making him out to be an useless sack of shit. 
People are just actively trying to find faults in his game at times. 

He was effective and I thought he had a decent game.

2805~~~
Just a bit!

You see, I actually don't have a problem with people thinking we could do better. I'm also a big fan of Rafael so can understand why people are frustrated about him being frozen out.

What's getting really stupid, though, is the desperation of some people to try and find a way to have a go at Valencia, when he's done absolutely feck all wrong. Just makes them look stupid tbh. He had a good game against Chelsea. One of our better players. This evidently bothers some people. Oh well.

2806~~~
I think that he has, generally, been very good at right-back, and it's completely understandable that he's keeping Rafael out of the team. He is however 30 years old and not anything more than a good right back and that's why we absolutely need to get a higher quality, younger RB than him this summer, but he definitely deserves to stay and fight for a place with them.*

I've been extremely critical of him in the last few years, he went from one of my favourite players to one of my most loathed in the space of a summer, but he deserves credit for reinventing himself for us.

*As long as he never plays as a winger again, ever.

2807~~~
Jaysus. What did he get up to on his summer holidays?

2808~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Ok, slight exaggeration. What I meant was that he ended 11/12 in amazing fashion, winning POTY, only to somehow turn to complete dogshit instantly next season. It was actually really bizarre, such a massive fall from grace.

2809~~~
Cool. Thought he'd thrown the gob at your missus.

Yeah, his decline was odd. Especially because he had a run of decent games when he first game back after that leg break. It's a shame but it looks as though we'll never see him regain his ability as a winger. As a fullback, though, he's improved a huge amount this season. Along with Young and Fellaini he would be one of the players who seems to have learned and progressed the most under Van Gaal. Probably Hererra too, come to think of it. All of them are obviously intelligent players, willing to learn and adapt their games to fit the manager's game plan. So long as Van Gaal is in charge, that's exactly what we need.

2810~~~
No, go rewatch it. Fabregas was way out of the offensive equation on the touch line. Hazard was bursting through a massive gap in our line and Valencia just stood there and watched him. Do you actually think Oscar was going to find Fabregas on the touchline who had 2 United players on him? The play was obvious; knock it into Hazard's path because of the run he was making.

2811~~~
He's actually well capable of defending, his positioning at times needs to be questioned but he's not a RB by trade so it can be excused. One thing that grinds my gears is how little he tries get forward now a days, its like he's terrified of losing the ball up the field. He offers little or no danger at all going forward. 

With Shaw and a proper attacking RB (Rafael?) Next season we'll be too much to handle for most teams.

2812~~~
SO obvious Herrera who was there should have seen it - good point! Valencia was one of the two players stopping the pass to fabregas as OScar improvised with a flick...if Herrera had done his job at tat moment it would have come to nothing - he just had to track or foul Hazard.

Posters is here are being ridiculous as usual - if Valencia had gone centrally to try and cover Herrera's mistake in that split second, and then Oscar passed wide to Fabregas you all would have said he shouldn't have gotten pulled out of position <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Haters gonna hate <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2813~~~
Oscar could've played it to Fabregas, yes. But was Fabregas making a run? No. Go read my earlier post; I said both Ander and Valencia were at fault. But it's crazy how some people are letting Valencia off free here. Were you in Oscar's position would you have decided to play a horizontal pass to a player not making a run when there's your best attacking player running off you into a massive gap? Don't sugar coat things. He messed up. They both did.

2814~~~
Right, I'm fed up of this - it's really feckin' stupid.

Valencia is not at fault for this goal - watch the gif again.



Right, Fabregas is running right at him, literallly... he is running with the ball, towards Valencia... at this point, what should Valencia do? Stand his ground, or run away and magically decide to double up on Hazard, even though, at that point, Herrera is goal side and has him. We do not man-mark, and at this point, Cesc and Hazard had switched positions - so Fabregas is Valencia's man and Hazard is Herrera's - so the correct answer is that Valencia either a) quickly closes down Fabregas, or b) stand's his ground. This is the <b>ONLY </b>place you can possible criticise him for, in that he doesn't press on Fabregas quickly, which, considering he had Mata on his back, would have made life harder for Fabregas and possibly prevented him from playing the pass to Oscar, but that is it.

As the play develops, Hazard only becomes free pretty much when Oscar releases the ball with the backheel - by this point, Hazard has caught Herrera out and is gone. Valencia is quick, but so is Hazard, and there is absolutely no way he is catching him. Hazard is free and through on goal and there is bugger all Valencia can do about it - except perhaps a cynical lunge to take him out, though a) that's not his style, and b) he might have got that wrong and given away a penalty.

In conclusion - the goal is, in no way, Valencia's fault.... and to criticise him for it is utterly ridiculous.

2815~~~
nope you are wrong. rafael would have stopped that <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2816~~~
Well that's a given, Hazard would have been so distracted by his luscious curly hair that he would have forgotten to even make the run.

2817~~~
It appears the 4 or 5 agenda posters in here secretly hoped AV had lunged wildly there, gotten his red card, and given them a penalty with us a man down for the better part of an hour.

2818~~~
He's been great last couple of games. Still think we could do better though.

2819~~~
My thought after seeing the gif.
It was primarily Herrera's fault cause he lost Hazard and then had made a mistake by not trying to close him down but let Smalling do it and he has drifted right. he just needed to track Hazard all the way, not let him go to have a clear shot. 

Valencia isnt at fault but when he saw Hazard bursting he tried to close him and then suddenly just stopped. Hazard is quick sure but I dont understand why Valenica just gave up in the middle of his run.

Also could DDG have done better? Its the 1st post, so there's always a question should keeper have done better.

2820~~~
It's a bit weird to just stop like he did - but he definitely wasn't catching him, so it didn't make any difference in the grand scheme of things.

De Gea does fine, shots perfectly between the legs are always difficult to stop from such a close range.

2821~~~
He wasnt catching him but he should have persist with the run maybe and at least make it difficult for him somehow, I dont know.

It was a good shot by Hazard but maybe DDG should have closed his angle better, maybe by staying closer to the post.

Which reminds me, I conceded a stupid goal between my legs during the weekend, it was a weak shot and it was really embarrasing but that's another story. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2822~~~
It was a very good finish. No more of a goalkeeping error than Mata's goal last weekend.

2823~~~
When you see that angle it goes beyond ridiculous that people are even thinking about blaming him. 

Hazard started fairly deep and very centrally, should have been picked up by Herrera and then the route he took was past where Smalling should have been. 

The positional issue started from the left side of defence. Shaw should have dropped in behind Drogba quicker and communicated with McNair to take Oscar which would have stopped Smalling being dragged out of position and leaving a gaping hole for Hazard to attack. 


The main issue there was McNair's positioning. He was caught in no minds land with one eye on Drogba and one eye on Oscar. 


The main thing this highlights though is the problem we can have when we are too easily dispossessed and in the wrong phase of position. Shaw got caught out trying to get back and pick up Drogba which meant McNair had to pick him up. That left Smalling being dragged over to Oscar and Hazard room to attack in behind him.

2824~~~
He lives in England since 10 years and his interviews (on MUTV) are still in spanish <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2825~~~
It's absolutely mental isn't it. Apparently LVG ordered him to get English lessons when he arrived at the club. I really just think he's not particularly bright.

2826~~~
He's a professional footballer who hasn't learnt how to take a throw-in and you are expecting him to learn a new language. Like lower your expectations and shit.

2827~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> great point.

2828~~~
Valencia is <b>so</b> under-rated here that it leaves me wondering what am I missing in my assessment of the player. 

Calm, authoritative and commanding, I have not seen a single side (that I can recall), in the Premiership that has been able to handle or subdue him completely. 

True, he can't get around defenders any more (he hasn't been able to do that for a few years), he remains a handful for most sides who end up putting two or more players  on him which is a testimony to his abilities.

I'd like to see him moved into Carrick's position when he's injured as I think he could handle it. It would save having to move Rooney there who is better as our main attacker.

2829~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> brilliant. I often think the channels frozen when he's taking a throw in too.

2830~~~
Maybe he's to shy to speak english. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2831~~~
I was with you till the Carrick position thing (he doesn't have the intelligence of Carrick to do this he'd be better if moved centrally suited more as a box to box player) but he is fine where he is and this centrally should be confined to emergency use only. As a right back he's well on his way to becoming the best in the league.

2832~~~
How many times has a professional referee or linesman penalised him after a throw-in? Once? How many throw-ins has he taken in his United career?

Methinks Antonio Valencia has better idea about what is and isn't a foul throw than you do <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

He's got an unusual technique, that's for sure but it obviously works for him and (crucially) for the match officials, so no harm done.

2833~~~
It just looks incredibly awkward because his shirt doesn't give his chest enough room to expand and his biceps barely fit past his ears.

2834~~~
That gif sums it up perfectly. Valencia is doing his job by narrowing the space that Fabregas has to run into and forces him to play what can be seen as a nothing ball if not for Oscar's ingenuity. By the time Hazard has left his man no defender in the league is catching him. If Carrick is playing I don't think we give away that goal.

2835~~~
I was joking anyway but he's been called more than once this year and the commentators have even called him out on more than one occasion where the refs didn't penalise him for it. He take every throw-in down the right side.

Methinks he doesn't as it isn't even about his unusual technique half the time but rather he blatantly lifts his back leg a foot off the ground. There is harm done as well, as he has been called on it and it is a needless way to give away possession.

2836~~~
I can honestly only remember him being blown up once and must have watched him take hundreds of throws by now. Dunno why he does it tbh but the ref lets it go 99.9% of the time, so his technique must be generally ok.

2837~~~
How does that make any sense? His technique is fine because he's rarely punished for it?

His technique isn't ok, and 99.9% of the time it should be deemed a foul throw. It's not, but that's because of the ineptitude of the referee and linesman with regards to that ruling, but if they were competent then it would bve a foul throw almost every time.

2838~~~
In your opinion.

Yet people who earn a living as match officials in top flight professional football evidently see things differently. They have the exact opposite opinion, in fact.

In answer to your question, yes, his technique is fine if he's not punished for it. A foul throw isn't a foul throw unless it's penalised. Just like a player who is almost never gives away free-kicks can't be accused of commiting too many fouls.

2839~~~
It's not OK, its astonishingly shocking and if Refs decide to enforce the law properly then 99.9% of his throw ins would be a foul. Thankfully the refs can't be arsed with it so he gets away with it.

2840~~~
They "can't be arsed" enforcing the rules of the game? Seems legit.

2841~~~
Yes, much in the same way as they don't penalise shirt pulling or grappling in the box, are you suggesting that is within the law? Anyway the official ruling on throw ins:

At the moment of delivering the ball, the thrower:
faces the field of play
has part of each foot either on the touchline or on the
ground outside the touchline
uses both hands
delivers the ball from behind and over his head

2842~~~
I think most of them don't care too much about foul throws if it's "close", and Valencia's are generally usually on the edge, so I think he gets away with it. If it's truly awful then they whistle for them, but all professional footballers do half assed throw ins all the time that probably should be called back.

2843~~~
I'm aware of the rules. I've player competitive football before. I'm also absolutely certain the referees and assistant referees are aware of them too. Yet Valencia almost never (as in, less than one in a hundred) gets penalised. There's a reason for that and it's not about not being arsed.

2844~~~
I think that's it. I've no idea why he takes the risk but it works out ok for him, so it's no big deal. Completely different story if he was getting picked up on it regularly. That really would be stupid.

2845~~~
Well if you know the rules then you know he's taking throw ins incorrectly. Whether the ref penalises him or not is completely irrelevant.

2846~~~
Uh... It's actually completely relevant. It couldn't be more relevant.

2847~~~
I can't believe you only remember it happening once. It's happened more than that and it's inexcusable.

2848~~~
Uh... No really it doesn't. We aren't discussing the application of the law, we are discussing the law. They are two different things.

2849~~~
Indeed. One is relevant to events on the pitch, one isn't. Guess which is which?

2850~~~
Absolutely, its a shame you seem unable to differentiate between the two.

2851~~~
I think it's pretty obvious that refs are either not seeing his foul throws or they just can't be bothered with them unless it is blatant. I've seen a few foul throws not get called in other matches too. Referees just let it slide because it's a relatively minor thing.

2852~~~
Foul throws are the biggest nerd alert in football. You really get very little advantage by lifting a leg or releasing the ball slightly early, the ref's just can't be fussed to pick them up on it. Tbh they might aswell be kick ins!

2853~~~
Don't know why but feeling a Valencia goal tonight.

2854~~~
Would be nice to see, can't remember the last time he scored

2855~~~
What was he playing at for that goal eh?

2856~~~
Was poor but we still had chances to clear the danger afterwards.

2857~~~
Yes, everything is Valencia's fault.

2858~~~
Yes, nothing is Valencia's fault, you can't deny his decision making was poor there, still McNair should've done better.

2859~~~
Blind and McNair were in the thick of it. Valencia if i recall wasn't even near them. Plus McCarthy was the beneficiary of a lucky bounce and very good finish.

2860~~~
I was being facetious <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2861~~~
I knew you were. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> I was directing my sarcasm at the agenda posters.

2862~~~
The reason the counter attack was on was because Valencia stepped forward to try and challenge Lukaku in the air, he was never going to beat him and he was the pace at the back covering. Still, McNair should've made more of his tackle.

He's looked good going forward though, he's actually shaping his crosses now.

2863~~~
Offers nothing but to stop time and play as deep as possible

2864~~~
Valencia again ?

2865~~~
By far and away our weakest player IMO. Not his fault he's not a right back.

2866~~~
let's see the agenda posters defend that.

2867~~~
Looked every inch a winger trying to mark a centre half there.

2868~~~
Apparently Van Gaal has an agenda does he ? Get over it. He could've done better, but it was a sublime header.

2869~~~
we really need to replace him in the summer. he's found out against every half decent team.

2870~~~
I'd have loved to see Valencia try to defend that.

2871~~~
Hilarious how so many people were oblivious to his pathetic defending tendencies until it is shoved blatantly in our faces. I've never known a player to gift so many goals. Even the clueless posters must be able to catch on after this.

Edit: Okay that outburst was too far but man I am just pissed off at this lot getting the better of us again. Ignore me.

2872~~~
If only it was Rafael marking him.

2873~~~
Even if you take away his pitiful defending, he is absolutely nullifying any pace down the right. Him and Mata are having a competition to see who can slow down play quicker.

2874~~~
Our weak link.

2875~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> course he doesn't. But apparently having an opinion = having an agenda on here if you criticise the precious Valencia . If he stabbed someone you would say they ran into knife. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2876~~~
I like to think of it as supporting our players insteading of the insufferably tedious weekly knee jerking.

2877~~~
The fact its weekly is because he's making mistakes weekly. I'd love for him to do well because he's a United player, I haven't anything against him he seems like a genuinely nice bloke but he isn't good enough, I don't find any stock in pretending everything is rosey, or defending him when he makes errors, what's the point in that? I want the best for my team.

2878~~~
My gripe with that is the organization. Never mind the fact Stones gets a good 3 or 4 yards of space, why is Stones being marked by a RB anyway?

2879~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2880~~~
He's a liability at the back. He's cost us too many goals this season.

2881~~~
The corner was his fault obviously but not the first goal.

2882~~~
I don't why he takes 5 touches on the ball and then makes the obvious pass which he could have done 5 seconds before.

2883~~~
I say he's shite every week so I'd hardly call it kneejerking.

The fact is he makes very, very basic errors week in week out. Sometimes they cost us, sometimes they don't. Today he's hardly solely at fault for both goals, but its the sort of mistakes he always makes.

2884~~~
Headless chicken. How slow are his over laps? Takes him ages to trundle along up there.

2885~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2886~~~
This is why we need a specialist RB

2887~~~
Scientist reckon he was responsible for the Nepal earthquake.

2888~~~
I'm mainly objecting to the fixation with blaming for everything. The first goal was a team effort and Valencia was 50 yards away from the box when the goal was scored. He could've done better on the 2nd.

2889~~~
I dont see how its supporting your player by letting him get away with poor play time and again. He's going to continue making mistakes if he's not called out and action isnt taken.

He will only improve if he knows it isn't acceptable and he has to do more. Its like being a soft parent not reprimanding a misbehaving child, you aren't helping at all

2890~~~
Stopgap player, not good enough in the grand scheme of things. And before I get the now favourite caf saying 'knee jerk', I have said it all season.

2891~~~
He's been very good at times this season but man I just hate watching him play. He's so one footed and predictable, generally just passes 2 metres sideways or backwards and 9/10 of his crosses are complete shite.

2892~~~
The first goal obviously wasn't anything to do with him. The second goal was his man that scored but in fairness it was a brilliant run and header by Stones

2893~~~
Souness saying he was fouled for the first goal, interesting.

2894~~~
Very poor for both goals.

2895~~~
First goal he should have let Lukaku win the ball. Valencia is back for a reason, which is to stop the counter.

2896~~~
His marking for the second is even worse when you see the corner before it.

2897~~~
He wasn't, though.

2898~~~
At fault in both goals, we need a proper right back asap.

2899~~~
It wasn't a brilliant run. He ran in a straight line for 10 yards at most. Valencia was completely the wrong side and didn't even try and impede his run, completely rubbish.

2900~~~
I don't think he is at fault for everything, but he was definitely most involved one for majority of goals we conceeded over last month or two. Easily our worst defender this season apart from Evans and Blackett.

2901~~~
The lads a fecking liability. And has been for over 2 years now. Not good enough for United.

2902~~~
I don't understand how people can blame him for the first goal. Beyond ridiculous

2903~~~
For the first goal he attacked the ball when it came out from the corner when he should have stayed as the furthest (and only) man behind the ball.

2904~~~
Debatable, he was shoved whilst jumping.

Obviously, if it was another player, we'd more likely to accept it as a foul, but as it's the much maligned Valencia, we won't call it a foul.

2905~~~
I don't blame him for the first goal, but second goal is definitely his mistake.

2906~~~
He's to blame for the second but the first I say he's a little blame as he has to be 100% certain you'll get the ball if that's your position. Blind was more at fault for the first goal (disappointing)

2907~~~
He was in the middle and competed for a ball with Lukaku. It was merely one cog in an improbable sequence of events that led to the goal.

2908~~~
Same shit but he's not a RB as has been proven time and time again, LvG giving him a restictes role hasn't changes that. 

id prefer Rafael and Jones at right back but they ain't fit so we have to put up till summer

2909~~~
Well it was. He deals with it and we're not on the ropes. People saying it might have been a foul. Maybe so, not seen a proper replay.

2910~~~
He is back in defence for a corner to stop the counter. Not rush in. He wasn't going to win that header vs Lukaku.

2911~~~
Yep. Its rash play taking himself out of the game again. And if you watch the replay, players like Blind are running back as fast as possible while once again Valencia casually walks back.

He has absolutely no regard for defensive responsibility. He plays like its someone else's job to defend

Rafael was absolutely roasted every time he was caught out with positioning or was over-aggressive and rash. Valencia is more guilty of those mistakes

2912~~~
Well you could say that about any goal.

2913~~~
Exactly, its a team effort.

2914~~~
I agree but competing for that ball with Lukaku of all people is obviously a brain dead decision in the first place for a player weak in the air. Plenty went wrong after that of course but a natural defender drops off in that situation and it becomes less dangerous. Just poor decision making that continues to contribute to so many goals we concede.

2915~~~
In before.... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2916~~~
No words

2917~~~
Never to blame.

2918~~~
Sigh.

2919~~~
He's fair intelligent

2920~~~
A decent defender but has too many mistakes. Get rid, bring back Rafa.

2921~~~
so fecking brainless.

2922~~~
You've stolen it from us!

2923~~~
Brainless fecker.

2924~~~
Nothing new here, he's not and never has been a viable option as our long term RB solution. He simply isn't good enough and has been at fault for so many goals this season.

2925~~~
Now Rafael is out for the season, we don't really have any alternative option at rightback

2926~~~
Shocking from him then. No excuses.

2927~~~
and to think rafael cant get a game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2928~~~
He's not been good today, but good to see that people still are going overboard with their criticism.

2929~~~
Good enough for a squad player.  Not good enough if you want to win anything of value.

2930~~~
Of all the days to peddle the 'he's hard done by' line you pick today?

2931~~~
It's all very well saying he can do a job but he's cost us countless number of points this season. Of course we need a fecking right back. It's a priority position. He can do a job but it's the basics a right back needs to do he's struggling with, case in point, the third Everton goal.

2932~~~
Nope, just that people are much too harsh - he's been at fault for two goals, arguably, and thus he hasn't been any good, but brainless fecker and whatnot is just a bit over the top for me. I like him, but he's been poor today.

2933~~~
He's such a ball watcher. That's his biggest problem.

2934~~~
He's an absolute idiot.

2935~~~
And you sound like Stephen Hawking - without the intelligence, of course.

2936~~~
He has had a bit of a nightmare. Which is a shame as his form had been good

2937~~~
I don't think they are. Not only has he played terribly, being at fault for every goal, he's meandered about without a care in the world.

2938~~~
How the hell was he at fault for the third goal? That's sweet.

2939~~~
I'm not playing right back for Man Utd though. Thankfully.

2940~~~
See, that's a legitimate post! Spot on, mate.

2941~~~
Err...

2942~~~
Touche <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Not sure you need to be all that brilliant though to play football when all things are said and done.

2943~~~
Wat.

2944~~~
The entire defense stopped, Smalling, McNair could have continued running, as well. Why do people overlook that? It's a 4 man defense...

2945~~~
First of all it's an offside considering Lukaku ran far enough for McNair to stop running - he should not have stopped and thus would easily have reached the ball.

2946~~~
Not really. He's been awful. He's clearly a makeshift RB and we need a far more assured player to play there.

2947~~~
I've given up - I think you should too. Save your energy for shopping, or mowing your lawn - better spent, I tell ya.

2948~~~
I assume it's because he, along with the rest of the defense, switched off. Miracles was Valencias man tbf. But yeah, we definitely need a rb- but Valencias has been a decent stand in. Not first choice material though.

2949~~~
He's been poor today, but he's had a good season overall.

2950~~~
He's simply not a right back, would he be good enough for Chelsea, Bayern, Barca or Real at the position? Definitely not, so why should we resign ourselves to say that he can do a job for us. Those are the teams that we should be competing with and Valencia wouldn't get a sniff at any of them. Keep him on the bench and bring in someone competent in the summer. Until then we'll just have to put up with him.

2951~~~
Extremely poor today.

2952~~~
He was also at fault. How anyone can possibly reason that Valencia wasn't at fault for that goal is just mental. He's more got more to answer for because it was his man that scored.

2953~~~
He's made other mistakes during the season. He's not the answer to our RB problem. I have no problem keeping him as a backup but we need an actual RB brought in this summer. He has been adequate and had some good games but he has never fully convinced me.

2954~~~
In the summer a right back is a must. Rafael is just too rash and Valencia is too prone to the "what the fu@k" moments.

Hes always the weak link in our teams be it at RB or RW
Come off it, should have looked around because thinking there was no one behind him

2955~~~
Who wasn't? We've fecking regressed so much in just two games... All we do is pass the ball around for fun and do nothing.

2956~~~
It was just a stupid goal from all ends. In my book that is as clear an offside, but McNair should not have stopped running and would have been the first to catch it - more his fault than anyone else, except the ref who has been abysmal.

2957~~~
Correct. Expecting a bunch of 'should never play again' posts.

2958~~~
All players make mistakes. Ridiculous thinking otherwise. I remember Evra being blamed for a goal when there was a cross from Evra's side, Vidic cleared the ball and there was a goal from the rebound. Sometimes the Caf just needs scapegoats. 

He was poor today, very poor in fact, but he's had a good season.

2959~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>How can you argue he's not at fault for the third goal?
The run from deep comes from his side, his man is not offside so he has to stay with him.

2960~~~
Valencia isn't helping you at all. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2961~~~
His form has been OK recently on the whole. But anyone who thinks the mistakes today are out of the blue is extremely naive. It's no coincidence there have been goals in recent weeks where we've seen a gaping gap down our right hand side (Monreal, Aguero, Hazard), and you can make arguments why other players also made mistakes too in these goals, but Valencia's positional mistakes and ball watching have been seen there, as well as another brainfart in the Welbeck goal. 

The rest of his game is good, but he's just not a natural RB. He's very good 1 vs 1 when the play is in front of him, but as soon as the ball gets played behind him he struggles.

2962~~~
He's special....

2963~~~
<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/> I'm running interference for Tony and he lets me down.

2964~~~
I know he's out now but surely Rafael's defending cannot be much worse?  he can be shaky at times but at least he is a proper RB

2965~~~
I'll say this again. 

Throw in his utter impotence going forward and utter inability to put in a cross or inject any pace into our play on the flanks and we are severely handicapped. Get rid of.

2966~~~
Rafael is twice the player.

2967~~~
A shame Rafa is injured because he should have been getting a game now. Poor from Valencia today I thought. He just doesn't have the brain when the ball is not within 5m of him.

2968~~~
He literally can't cross a ball to save his life, can he? I thought the stick he was getting on here lately was a bit unfair, but today he was dreadful bar maybe a few good runs in the 1st half.

2969~~~
Other than letting Mirralas had a free run for one on one, it's not his fault. Or am I being wooshed here?

2970~~~
Abysmal today. Apart from a few powerful runs he was a liability.

2971~~~
Him and McNair were at fault.

2972~~~
Nothing to do with scapegoats. Today, for me, changes nothing; we need an actual RB this summer or we will suffer. Valencia isn't the man for the job. He's done ok this season, but as I said, he clearly isn't a RB.

2973~~~
True enough - he's not a RB by trade, but he's done well. He plays RB but people criticize him for not being a winger in attack. He offers more in attack than most other RBs in the league, if not at the level we want him to. He held Hazard in his pocket for most of the match, and it was his speed that kept Aguero from being clean on goal. He's made mistakes that has cost us goals, but we have strikers that miss 100% chances that also do the same. Every player in the team has made mistakes that cost goals.

2974~~~
his defending was awful that's right but I'm still more pissed by his brainless contribution to attacking. This is ridiculous how he managed to stay in the team for his surprisingly solid defensive displays. Rafael is three times better defender, and better going forward too, it's really unfair he had to play so many games in reserves and unfortunately got kicked in the ribs. I wasn't convinced we needed a RB until today. Valencia looked solid and I was waiting for him to pick such game to van Gaal give a a chance to Rafael regain his position back, Valencia could be a good back up RB but right now. It's not going according to plan.. 

now we'll go full retard for clyne

2975~~~
Safe to say at fault for every single one of the 3 goals today. 

If there was a 1 as a rating he'd get one.

2976~~~
Offside, and why should he sprint like a maniac when McNair was much, much, much closer to the ball anyways?

2977~~~
gash

2978~~~
You are joking right?

2979~~~
Not offside. McNair was tracking an offside Lukaku, and Miralas was all Valencia's.

2980~~~
That was a week old fish down a hobos pants level stinker from Valencia today.

2981~~~
He is not a RB. A RB, any RB, would not have let Mirralas have that free run for the third. 

Rafael's injury is far from being a disaster as he has no future at the club. In fact, if a couple of good performances from him now would have stopped us from signing a first choice RB in the summer then it would have been more damage done than playing a poor Valencia for th e remainder of the season.

2982~~~
Directly responsible for all three goals. Provided literally nothing going forward, not that he has for two or three years now.

The only player more useless than Falcao on the pitch today.

2983~~~
The bit in bold irks me the most. Anyone can have a bad game but he does it so often. It's like he feels he cannot catch up with play then why bother running back.

2984~~~
if we can give Young and Fellaini time, two of the biggest scapegoats since early days Fletcher and Richardson, we can surely give another season to Rafael to regain his best form.

2985~~~
You are right. Why should he sprint? Should have just lay down on the pitch for a small nap I say.

2986~~~
Its particularly annoying when we hear all the time about him being a hard worker. He's a hard worker when we have the ball, he's very lazy when we dont.

2987~~~
Even Neville was critical of him today. He normally defends Valencia no matter what.

2988~~~
Managed to feck up for all 3 goals. That's impressive even for him. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

A new RB should be our top priority for the summer.

2989~~~
He was poor defensively today.

2990~~~
Not a Carrick replacement?

2992~~~
He's done well enough against the kick and run merchants and lesser teams, but has been found out a bit in recent weeks.

I would also disagree that he offers a lot in attack, for someone who was the one of the best wingers in the league once, he's been pretty average going forward. Shaw offered much more penetration vs Chelsea, Blind was better going forward when playing LB and Young outshone him from the LWB position in the 3-5-2. He has the tools to be doing a lot better than those three, but he's lost any balls/confidence he had 3 years ago.

On a final note, I would also say there is a handful of posters who insist there is an agenda against him (some unwarranted criticism, but no more than say Rooney gets regularly) and engage in blame game gymnastics whenever he does something wrong. I've seen posts calling him the best RB in the league for example. It's almost impossible to have an objective discussion about his merits as a RB with some of these posters.

2993~~~
He's been here for ages. His fitness record has always been awful. We should have had a first choice RB long ago. A fit Rafael is not more realistic than a fit Anderson.

2994~~~
A picture of Rafael losing a header to Carroll. That's me told.

2995~~~
Thought he was ok attacking, saw some good crosses. Problem is that Everton were solid in defense today, where we couldn't get a single ball to our man unless they were in absolute acres of space. 

In terms of being at fault for the goals, the level of blame on him starts low then ends high. Shame as I thought his previous performances prior to this showed some promise.

2996~~~
He's been played out of position for so long. We should keep him as back up for both a first choice RB  and a RW.

2997~~~
Valencia would never have that leap. He lost to Stones today, nowhere near the same height. Besides, it's usually Rafael on post duty not marking targets, so maybe someone with some concentration and some fight would have marked Stones?

He has the pace and the power and the height but not the workrate, commitment, positioning, and on-the-ball skill. 
When your positioning is much worse than Rafael, that's a warning sign.

2998~~~
Even then, i wouldn't trust him for such duty, especially not as a backup RB.

To the same title as the other players who left us on the transfer deadline, I think it's time we cut our losses with him in the upcoming summer too.

2999~~~
Been a great servant to the club since '09, and he's helped us to a couple of trophies. But I think the time has come for him to either move on, or not be 1st pick as RB. The fact that we had Rafael from Dec-Apr ready to play is mis-management imo.

3000~~~
I think a few more people have realized after his performance today that he isn't good enough to be our first choice RB in the future.

3001~~~
He shouldn't get looked at as a winger again for us, if we plan on moving forward. A solid full back with nothing special about his ability. Something that should be rectified in the summer if Rafael is done here.

3002~~~
Played like a defender in attack, and an attacker in defence. Woeful.

3003~~~
At least half the goals we concede are either significantly or entirely his fault. 

We concede goals that other, poor or average teams never do, because Valencia doesn't know how to pay attention during a game of football. 

It's not a one or two time thing and it's not a recent thing. It's been happening all season and it crops up in every game.

You can only argue that his quality on the ball compensates for his complete inability to do his  job without it...but actually you can't even argue that. Every time Valencia gets the ball the game has to stop and take a break for 5 seconds while he decides what he wants to do with it.

If he played in defence for a poor side he'd get them relegated. I genuinely think he's that sub standard. The solution to having an average winger isn't to convert them into one of the most piss poor defenders in the league.

The really baffling thing is there were people earlier in the season claiming Van Gaal had improved him! He's had one decent game all season and that was in midfield against Everton at OT.

I've never known another player who gets rewarded for getting gradually worse with more and more game time

3004~~~
My problem with Valencia has always been that he is such a limited player. In the current system he almost gets away with it because Mata cuts inside, giving Valencia the sole duty of just bombing up and down the wing, on the byline. He is just so predictable though. I find it laughably pathetic that a professional footballer of his age and experience, can literally not use his weaker foot to the extent that it severely weakens his all round play.

I have been saying for months that if we dont want to use Rafael, then a new RB should be priority #1 in the summer - more important than a CB, more important than a CM or winger or whatever else.

3005~~~
First goal: he gets a nudge from Lukaku as he's jumping. McNair and Blind are at fault for letting McCarthy waltz through, like a bunch of school boys. McNair also had a wild lash at the ball, which provided a great assist for the goal. 
Second goal: McNair initiated danger, the initial corner, from some rubbish defending. Although, Stones was Valencia's man, so he's largely responsible.
Third goal: He can't see Mirallas and follows his team mates in halting and appealing for an offside, which it was. It actually looks as if the linesman flagged from the reaction of our players. Horrible refereeing.

3006~~~
He seems to have a habit of forgetting that he's a right back, which is not ideal given he seems to have no recollection of being a right winger either.

3007~~~
Yep. Evra was also quite bad at this for the last few seasons he was with us and would get attacked quite often on here about it (rightfully so), but he was still such an attacking force that the positives generally outweighed the negatives. That is nowhere near the case for Valencia. There's been a number of goals or serious chances lately where he's been casually jogging (if that) back because he knows he can't get back to stop the player on the ball. Except the play has paused, it may have been passed around once or twice, and suddenly he would have easily had time to get back if he'd actually been trying. But because he's being half-arsed, we've still been a man down and that has ended up costing us.

I wish Rafa were fit. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3008~~~
Sell. Need. New. RB. X2 (Janko?). Close. Thread.

3009~~~
Thought he was really poor today. Was particularly weak on the Lukaku challenge leading to the first goal, and is still virtually useless going forward. On top of that, he was out of position way too much, with Smalling basically covering for him for most of the game.

Also, getting on the ball and standing over it for 10 seconds <i>usually</i> isn't going to fool any defenders. Not impressed.

3010~~~
He was fit for a long time but still didn't play.

3011~~~
I'd rather we had Rafael as the backup RB next season than Valencia regardless of his fitness.

3012~~~
He's always been shit in the air and his positioning has always been suspect. This game just highlighted those weaknesses in the most brutal way possible. There's no way he should be our first choice right back next season.

3013~~~
Eventually, we're going to sign a proper RB, one who is capable of using both feet, putting in a cross and playing sound defence. And then we're all going to ask ourselves how we put up with Valencia at RB for so long. I love his attitude, and appreciate what he's done for the team, but he's simply not good enough anymore, either as a winger, nor as a RB.

3014~~~
Agenda right here folks! He's had about 3 bad games ( counting today, Arsenal in the cup and one or two others) in a entire season. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3015~~~
Agreed - he was basically fouled on the header attempt and mcNair should have actually attempted a proper tackle..a fould would have sufficed to stop the first goal.

2nd goal is his fault for losing his man.

3rd goal is poor refereeing - Lukaku is interfering by drawing the attention of our entire defence. It's a stupid rule and it's made worse by inept officials half the time.

3016~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> perfect

3017~~~
Problem with Valencia is how often does he drift out of position. He's a right back he spends most of his time ball chasing towards the center of the park.

3018~~~
He does it while on the ball too. And that's because of his one-footedness; he gets shunted infield because of his inability to beat his man or use his left foot for a pass. An added result of this is our play that gets congested in the middle and we're left unable to stretch it wide.

3019~~~
Never mind him being a rubbish winger these days, he even looks rubbish from an attacking perspective as a full back. If you convert a winger to a full back then you can maybe forgive them for their defensive inadequacies from time to time, but they're wingers for feck sake, they should at least be able to do something in attack. He's so hopeless with the football when he has it at his feet. He may as well take a book out of his pocket and read a chapter from it while we're waiting for him to decide what to do, at least that way he'd be more productive.

3020~~~
I know I'd be called a "spoilt fan" or "a glory hunter" for this but we won't get a better opportunity to offload Valencia, Young and Fellaini than this upcoming transfer window. Their stock is a high at the minute and we should cash in. It'll only fall from here on in. 

They won't be starters next season and I would rather have some younger, more hungrier players, as back-ups next season.

3021~~~
Absolutely fecking mental that people are trying to make him responsible for their first goal. Absolutely fecking mental, yet entirely predictable.

Second goal he <i>can</i> be blamed for but it was superb run and header by Stones. Absolutely no reason to think that any other right back in the same situation would have cleared the ball.

Third goal was a cluster-feck all round but yes, Valencia ultimately cost us by not tracking his man.

Overall he was crap. One of his worst games of the season. He's been looking a bit leggy in recent weeks and I was all in favour of giving him a spell on the bench with Rafael taking his place. I think I suggested something similar a week or two back. No chance of that now, though, because guess what? Rafael is injured.

3022~~~
I do not understand why Valencia is always the first name on the team sheet. He had been average at best and mediocre often. I get that some people like players who work hard, but he is so lacking in quality that no amount of hard work can make up for it. Even when the whole team is in form I hardly find him playing well at all.

If we have higher ambitions than just top 4 we should bin him this summer. Can't believe we went through the whole season without a decent RB (or at least playing one).

3023~~~
Who would those players be? 

Valencia ok, but we can keep Young and Fellaini cause we'll need a bigger squad to compete on 3 fronts.

3024~~~
BOOM! The A bomb has been dropped.

3025~~~
He just isn't even remotely good enough.

3026~~~
Fair enough, but it's not like the run from Stones was a particularly difficult one to predict, or stay with. A better defender might well have put in more of a challenge by staying closer to his man, making the header more difficult. Hardly the main reason to point the finger though, I agree.

3027~~~
Very poor yesterday, but he'll probably be on the bench next season and is a pretty decent option to have around the club in my view.

3028~~~
He is good at defending when it comes to one on one tussles, his strength is immense.

His issue is his ball watching/lack of concentration and general poor positioning. Its cost us about 3/4 goals this season.

My other big gripe is how wasteful he is when he gets into an attacking position, he just seems to put a half-hearted dink into the box and hope that someone meets it. I think I've seen him beat a man once this season (Rooney goal vs Liverpool). He just seems devoid of any creativity and even that burst of pace that he used to have when attacking appears to have vanished

Has done a decent job for the most part but if Rafael can't get back to fitness and regain that RB spot then we need to invest, won't be challenging for league titles with Valencia as a fullback

3029~~~
his thread isn't even good enough to be in the mains. there should be a sub-forum for players who are this poor.

3030~~~
He's just making too many mistakes that are costing us. For all his effort and love, it's not good enough. He can be a good back up but not more

3031~~~
Sunday just reinforces how much we need a quality, and consistently fit, right back. We can't possibly go into next season with Valencia as a starter and hope to win anything.

He's probably just about worth keeping as a backup right back but even then I don't know.

3032~~~
Shame Rafael got injured as he may have had a chance at getting some games. I expect Valencia to be pretty determined to bounce back and perform though.

3033~~~
The unfortunate thing is that Valencia has a great attitude in the squad, has great physical attributes and has shown himself to be very grounded and level headed. He sacked his agent because he wanted to stay at the club, he never complained about being benched/lack of gametime, and physically he is an absolute tank.

If he was just a better footballer then he could be practically the ideal player.

3034~~~
Agree. Physically he's the best athlete I've seen play for United other than Ronaldo. You would think he could have been coached out of some of his shortcomings after 6 years here. Maybe the injury affected his confidence but he seems recovered physically so it's a bit of a mystery.

3035~~~
Just clearing a bit of whinge space before the match starts. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3036~~~
That goal was his fault. Just doing that now, so I don't have to type that later.

3037~~~
Sell him.

Offside but he got away with it, so all he had to do was cross it into the six yard box on a plate. He's fecking atrocious.

3038~~~
What the feck was that after the van Persie shot?

3039~~~
At fault for the goal. Atrocious.

3040~~~
All I can say is at least I learnt today that Valencia isn't the only PL footballer who doesn't know how to take a throw-in. I counted at least 3 from Dawson.

3041~~~
No idea why he starts week in week out. Under every fecking manager. Guy needs to be a monster in training

3042~~~
What did he do wrong for the goal? Not seen any replays

3043~~~
Worked hard but didn't offer a lot in the attack, a blunt instrument too often.

3044~~~
What? Terrible windup <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> - how can you confuse Valencia with mcNair (who gave away the foul)?

3045~~~
I can't get that cross at the end out of my head.

3046~~~
He's brutal. Painful to watch after seeing Dani Alves assist 3 earlier in a comfortable (8-0) win with similar one-sidedness to our game. 

We need better players. The forwards aren't helping but full backs are crucial when facing parked buses and we're getting nothing.

3047~~~
3 years of bad crossing. Until next week Antonio.

3048~~~
Watching him you wouldn't even know he used to be a winger. Atrocious stuff yet again, but is anyone really surprised?

3049~~~
One of the luckiest players in football, to be playing week in week out for us, yet being so average at everything.

3050~~~
I just beg and pray that he will be among the ones to be axed this upcoming summer. I'm just feckin' fed up with him, that's the bottom line.

3051~~~
Bloody hell he wasn't that bad. Did more than Blind anyway.
Won the penalty. Hope you Valencia-bashers are giving Di Maria just as much of a hard time.

3052~~~
I do. If it was for me, neither Valencia nor Di Maria would feature in the starting lineup based on their overall performances (or rather lack of), and I wouldn't put them on the pitch until they show me that they are wounded animals (and the psychology going with it).

3053~~~
I don't want to see him start for us regularly either, but this was not really a performance to particularly criticise him about. Apart from losing Lescott a few times on set pieces (why do we have him defend good headers of the ball? Have we not learnt?) he was comfortable defensively. His poor crossing was standard Valencia and no worse than our other players today.

3054~~~
How he lasted 90 minutes against a team that parked the double decker is beyond me. Surely Young should have gone to RB and Blind should have been left on as he can actually play football.

3055~~~
Signing a right back is essential, Valencia is a constant disappointment, can't beat a man despite being faster than most players, and only second to Bebe when he does get a cross away.

3056~~~
Bebe's crossing wasn't that bad. He had a howler that everyone seems to judge him but, but he did ok otherwise.

3057~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://soccer.indonewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/valencia.jpeg" src="http://soccer.indonewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/valencia.jpeg"/>

3058~~~
It's really funny that there are still people who are thinking that Valencia should be our first choice right-back next season.

3059~~~
That 'cross' after the RVP shot was saved, was he flagged offside?

All he had to do was pull it back for Mata and he had an open net, yet he managed to Bebe it out for a throw. Incredible.

I've long since lost confidence in Valencia making the right decision, particularly when it comes to decisive crosses/passes near the opponent's goal. 

His one-footedness, lack of touch on his passing/crossing, the total absence of any kind of goal-threat, the disappearance of the confidence to take on and beat his marker, as well as his at-times dodgy defending all make you wonder how long we can continue with this charade.

3061~~~
It's probably a bit late to continue this conversation but my point was purely that Valencia has no defensive instincts and is a huge weak link defensively. It's not scapegoating, it's just an opinion. For that reason I don't want him in the team. Conceding soft goals changes momentum in games and top teams cannot afford it.

I won't mention the Everton game because one game neither changes nor confirms that opinion. If you thought his defensive positioning for Hazard's goal was good then we'll just have to agree to disagree. I thought it showed a complete lack of awareness of where the danger was.

3062~~~
His corner marking is terrible. Let Lescott have a few free headers.

3063~~~
He won us the penalty - that was the best piece of offensive play we had all game. From a converted (and seemingly pure rubbish) fullback. We needed more attacking invention from the 5 -6 attackers in front of him and the rest of our defence. He's not top class in RB but he was better than several yesterday and our best option until summer.

3064~~~
Left foot cross! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3065~~~
That situation when he passed the ball back to Herrera for him to cross it even though he was in the penalty box running at speed with so much space and could try whatever he wanted with the ball summed how clueless he is in attack. It's actually sad how negative he is with the ball. As soon as we find new right back we'll be different team attacking wise.

3066~~~
What does Rafael do in training to not even get ahead of Valencia boggles my mind.

3067~~~
He's been absolutely horrendous these last few games. Beggars belief that this coincides with Rafael being crocked for the first time in ages. One of many really fecking annoying things that's happened this season.

3068~~~
He's been terrible these past few games.

3069~~~
Not his best game. I was annoyed by the number of stupid freekicks he conceded.

3070~~~
He's as thick as it comes tbh.

3071~~~
Worst player on our team today again. Keeps fouling people for no apparent reason.

3072~~~
That second half performance was one of the most brainless he's ever put in, which is some achievement by his standards. I said it last week but I'm more than happy to flog him come the summer. These kind of performances just aren't remotely acceptable.

3073~~~
His judgement speed is horrendous. He used to beat people just by kicking it and sprinting but now he takes about five seconds to make up his mind with everything he does. There was a point where Falcao was standing free past his man and he couldn't formulate a plan to get it to Falcao using his bad foot. Even when the ball is kicked in behind him at right back he takes 3 seconds for it to be acknowledged in his head, that or he can't get his head around the offside trap.

3074~~~
People might see it as knee-jerk, but he's lucky to be playing for us.

3075~~~
I don't mean to be so blunt, but he's really fecking shit.

3076~~~
He can stay as a back-up.  Not nearly good enough to be starting if we expect to win anything.

3077~~~
I've defended Valencia for most of the season, and I think a lot of has been justified, because even though he's been completely non-threatening, he's been defensively solid for a great deal of it. But all that solidity has gone to pot since around the Arsenal game in the FA Cup. He looks awful at just about everything now. Maybe he's knackered, as he seems to play more than anyone bar De Gea, but it's not an excuse for making such brainfart decisions, over and over.

Need a proper right back. Shame that the only proper right back we have is made of dog biscuits.

3078~~~
My heart was in my mouth every time Palace attacked that side, he looked so nervous. We need a new right back for sure but he's fine there as cover.

3079~~~
I saw him rated as one of our best players today in the post-match thread, I've defended him quite often this season but I thought he was very poor at both ends of the pitch.

3080~~~
It's not his fault, he shouldn't be playing there or still be at the club.

He should be playing solid but completely uninspiring football for someone around the bottom of the league, he can't be blamed for just being what he is.

3081~~~
We have gotten away with having him at RB for far longer than we should have, strictly back up.

3082~~~
players with no football rain shouldn't be allowed to step on the pitch, it's crazy how crazy dumb he is in some situations, I am very frustrated as much as with Rafael unfortunate injury, that could certainly be his chance..

3083~~~
He's bang average. The movement and passing of mata and Herrera creates so many openings on the right. Would have absolutely loved to see what rafa could do. 

We need a Rb desperately.

3084~~~
He just comes across as a bit dim on top of his obvious lack of quality. Needs way too much time to decide what to do when he gets the ball. Absolutely no self confidence either.

3085~~~
Think he had a good game or two after Arsenal but been pants for a while now. Which gives the resident haters an opportunity to pretend he's been this bad all season. He hasn't. Obviously.  Just a shame Rafael is crocked. Shite timing.

3086~~~
Even if he was playing in his correct position he should only be playing for a team like Everton, ridiculous that we have had to endure his inept RB performances all year and haven't given Rafael any chances at all (when fit).

3087~~~
I love him. Has way better technique than is given credit for. Strong on the ball and a great passer. Even his crossing is getting better. Usually does a number on his rival winger or left back, though sometimes leaves us on the edge of our seat. Fecks up now and again but who doesn´t? Wouldn´t trade him for any other right back in the PL. Not spectacular nor world class, but United through and through. Am not on the negative bandwagon.

To be fair, history shows that Ferguson, Moyes, Goggs and Van Gaal would surely be in accord.

3088~~~
He was great most of the year as RB but the past month (along with several other players tbf like Blind and even Yougn & Fellaini who've rediscovered themselves a bit today) he's gone off the boil since maybe the Everton loss. We need a proper RB but he'll still be a valuable squad player for next year if not a starter.

3089~~~
He's fine but I'm sure we'll bring in competition for him over the summer. He should really be playing a squad role if we have any hopes of winning the league or progressing to the later stages of the CL.

3090~~~
Worse than Evans and Blind? Come off it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3091~~~
That's all true but would you not agree he was terrible today and has been for the last few games? Ignoring that would be as biased as those comments implying he's been this bad all season.

3092~~~
His outside of the boot crosses make me want to cry.

3093~~~
Nobby is absurd when it comes to Valencia, always has been.

I just hope to feck he's our backup right back next year.

3094~~~
If only we had Nanikins . . .

3095~~~
I'd say he was worse than both of them too.

3096~~~
I thought he was ok today, and for the last couple of matches.

3097~~~
Difference being that when Nani went to shit I acknowledged it, something you've never done with Valencia. 

He was shit today and he's not good enough for Man Utd anymore.

3098~~~
Jaysus.

3099~~~
Well aren´t you my hero.

3100~~~
If even Pogue is saying he was shit then saying he was ok is truly scraping the bottom of the barrel.

3101~~~
Bring on the gifs of all his shit play

3102~~~
He gives away so many shit set pieces and free kicks in dangerous areas. Tony scares me as a right back.

3103~~~
OMG, it must be true. What did LVG think?

3104~~~
I thought Valencia was shocking today. He gave away so many needless free kicks and his final cross was the usual(awful). It seems so long since Valencia has skinned a player and made the right choice. He's a backup player at best, we really need to address that position in the summer. His work ethic is fantastic, he tries his best but it's a shame Rafa never got a proper chance this season. Valencia's negative style is frustrating to watch but maybe his confidence is just gone. I really hope he doesn't play as a regular next year.

3105~~~
I hate the way he looks to burst forward, checks back and passes it backwards to someone in a worse position, his defending is always questionable relying more-so on his athleticism than brain back there.
I dont rate him at all right wing either, but for the fact hes usually fit and so many other areas needing attention this summer I would say it's questionable how much hes worth keeping around as even a squad player.

3106~~~
So why does LVG (and Ferguson and Giggs and Moyes) insist on him? There are plenty of options for right back if he is so shocking.

Maybe LVG sees the same thing I do

3107~~~
I like Valencia and really wanted him to make it as a right back. It isn't happening though. Way too many mistakes and poor going forward. Rafael is twice the player but since he's never fit we need to buy

3108~~~
Who are the other options?

Rafael is the only right back we have and he's always injured.

3109~~~
And? Doesn't dispute the reality that he wasn't. Evans in his first minute slipped and gave a man a run into the box..less than 15 minutes later he's been nutmegged by Zaha also ona  run into our box. Evans was a desperate throw of the dice by LvG and was our worst defender. Blind was also very poor as our DM - didn't stop palace at all from attacking us, and didn't help set any tempo for us. If they had better strikers we'd have lost that game.

Valencia also created one chance for Fellaini early second half before they equalised(which everyone is forgetting) that Fellaini put right into Speroni's arms.

3110~~~
Give up guys. Only Nobby, SAF, LVG and Moyes can really see his quality.

3111~~~
Despite RB being the 1st position we'll go out and sign someone this summer? it's obvious Rafael hasnt the discipline to play LvG's system, not to mention his injuries, the only other option for the spot is a 19 year old McNair.
Besides which he was a completely different player and role played under Sir Alex for the majority.

3112~~~
Urm Paddy, Smalling, Big Phiw . . . Rafa was ready for much of the time. If he was so bloody shocking, surely a genius like LVG would´ve looked for someone else. Even in the Arse cup match of his massive feck up, LVG said he was our best player.

I trust your evaluation of Tony about as much as I consider your evaluation of the long gone Nanikins.

And why don´t you ask your boy Pogue about his evaluation of the Berbatoss vs Tevez debate. End of, ha ha

3113~~~
So a load of average center backs and a right back LvG doesn't rate.

You're a child.

3114~~~
I think he's played every week (beside's Rafael's injury) because he's average in a way that he doesn't hurt you too much.  But as the season has worn on, his play has gotten worse and we look more and more vulnerable on his side.  It is also criminal that Mata and Herrera link so well together on his side but they don't really have a second attacker option because he's totally clueless when he has the ball.

3115~~~
How am I a child? Cause I won´t join a jilted Nanboi and his bandwagon against one of our steadiest players and LVG´s decisions?

3116~~~
Because you post like a petulant little child.

3117~~~
Hell hath no fury like that of a jilted Nanboi

3118~~~
He has had a decent season but that's not enough for a club with our ambitions. His crossing is so poor that it's so easy to forget he's actually a winger who plays at RB.

3119~~~
I think his crossing has improved. Not great, but defo improved

3120~~~
Somehow Valenci get's into such good positions, but somehow fluffs every one of them.

3121~~~
I think today he was probably very aware of the attacking pace of the Palace wingers. He has not been as bad as people make out, but it obviously not his preferred position. I do not think LVG rate Rafael, I can't believe he has been injured all season.

3122~~~
I haven't seen much improvement really, but even if he did improve a bit it's still poor.

3123~~~
Give credit due for getting into good positions, and for some great passing and first touch. Of course from these good positions a goal or a chance is not created every time, but to say he "fluffs" it <b>every time</b>, is absurd, and knee jerk and bandwagonesque

3124~~~
He along with Johnny Evans are about as thick as they come, wtf? Sign a proper RB ffs.

3125~~~
This is much more typical of Valencia on attack these days. Nothing spectacular, but understated and spot on, and credit is never given.

3126~~~
Any specific examples or gifs of the thickness of this guy who´s made it all the way to the pinnacle of Man United football? Surely it is disrespectful of the club to say a player of such steadiness is as thick as they come

3127~~~
Between him and injury prone Shaw I know who I prefer. Can't understand all this criticism of Tony V. Consistently works his socks off, never shirks a problem and is pretty down to earth. Deserves a lot more credit.

3128~~~
This is the minimum requirement for ANY human being who has a job.

3129~~~
I can't be bothered mate. How about he stop giving away those silly freekicks when the opposition player isn't even facing him? And my point is not based on this one game, he works hard, down to earth, etc, if those are the qualities Manchester United want, then, I'm available, I'll sign for one tenth of what he earns.

3130~~~
Interested to know your opinion on Valencias recent performances mate. <a class="username" data-user="62594, @Tomuś" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/62594/">@Tomuś</a>

3131~~~
My favoutite Valencia moment today was in the first half, where he burst into the box, beat a defender, realised he then had to create something, so turned back, and passed it back out of the box to Herrera.

Classic.

3132~~~
That's not really typical, though. Typical would be turning around and passing back 5 yards to Mata. Not that I blame him for this, but it's obvious he's not confident in attack at all.

3133~~~
If you'd only started watching Utd this year and you were told Valencia used to be a really good attacking winger there's no chance you'd believe that. He offers almost nothing going forward and he's average at best defending. 

Surely he won't be a first teamer next season?

3134~~~
It counts for little. I've always loved Valencia as a player. So fecking powerful and determined. Don't get how anyone wouldn't be a fan. However if were being honest his deterioration as an attacking player has been crazy. He used to be so dangerous. In his first couple of seasons we'd give him the ball as much as possible safe in the knowledge he's beat his man and whip a decent cross in. What happened??? His end product is zero these days. He offers no threat to the opposition whatsoever. How can an attacking player lose all attacking ability or instinct?

3135~~~
I still like him as a player. I just don't understand him. What happened to Tony???

3136~~~
He put one cross right on Fellaini's head 2nd half..Fellaini headed it into Speroni's arms is all and now that moment doesn't exist.

3137~~~
In fact, in the gif that´s exactly what he does, turn around and pass it 5 yards back to Mata. And imo, as usual, it was exactly the right decision. As for losing the confidence in attack as a winger, I´d say your right, and a massive part of why he´s been brought back to right back. Take some of that pressure off. It´s obvious LVG, as well as Ferguson and Moyes wants him on the pitch. I think he and Mata are a good compliment to Young´s attack on the left.

I trust his decisions. After all, he´s a professional of Man United standards, has been for years, and not some self important punter sitting in front of the telly being hyper critical. LVG seems to trust him and rate him highly.

3138~~~
You serious?

3139~~~
An absolute disgrace, want him as RW again, maybe LVG can rediscover him.

3140~~~
Didn't think he was that bad today compared to the previous couple of games. He's definitely improved as a defender, but I still hope we sign a new first choice right back.

His crossing is so shit it beggars belief at times. A random guy from the crowd just randomly twatting the ball towards the box would have about as similar success rate in creating chances. It's like a cumbersome centre-back has found himself in the wing position after a corner or something.

3141~~~
Why? That makes little sense considering he doesn't take on his man anymore and can't cross.

Mata put him through three times to put in a cross and he screwed up.

He needs to start less games, if we are to challenge next season.

3142~~~
Dont know, LVG has done more things this season, making Ashley Young turn into Robery and turn Rooney into Chamakh and Cleverley during the season, I dont know, but earlier in the season, Valencia did fine, he could still be our defensive/holding winger (does this exist)?

I just dont know, but Im sick of this line up and it uninspires me every game as its so predictable.

3143~~~
Btw how has he gotten from arguably the best crosser in the world (first season) to tbe worst, it's really strange.

3144~~~
He's so unremarkable in every aspect of the game, apart from the fact that he looks like a proper tough bastard and he tries really hard. If that's all it takes we should just sign Cheick Tiote.

So what if he put a cross onto someone who has a head the size of a hot air balloon? He's pretty average going forward and he's prone to defensive lapses. We should expect more from a player who starts pretty much every game. I'd expect any right back to put in a threatening cross at some point a game, especially if their supposed strength is their attacking play. The Baines-Fellaini combo resulted in buckets of goals for Everton a couple of seasons ago. Valencia has managed two assists this season, and only one from a cross. That's abysmal for someone who used to rack up double figures for us playing as a winger, without having the advantage of being able to aim for Fellaini's massive hair.

3145~~~
He actually used to have a pretty decent chipped cross to the back post? Where's that disappeared from his locker?

3146~~~
You can see almost all our play of any intent comes from the left flank, as on the right as soon as the ball goes to valencia, whatever momentum was happening just dies, I really believe if Rafael was playing instead of him, we would cause teams a shit load of trouble

3147~~~
Huh?

I would personally trade him for most Right back's in the PL seeing as Valencia actually isn't one. And i quite like Valencia always have.

Antonio has did well at times this season, or as well as can be expected for a winger playing at RB. But we really need a much higher quality player in that position who can offer something going forward in this system LVG is implementing. Just being able to keep the ball is not good enough in my opinion. I like Tony V and hope we keep him as a back up but feck me i don't know how much more i could take of him turning round in circles at RB next season.

3148~~~
I like Valencia but, for a winger, he doesn't score anywhere enough goals.

3149~~~
Really want to see him as RCM again, thought he had his best game in the whole season in that position against Everton in the diamond.

We are quite thin in midfield as well so it wouldn't be the worst option and guaranteed he'll work hard, add speed and steel.

3150~~~
Work hard, speed and steel....These are the qualities that a winger for United needs? Feck me. 

Im saddened that Young couldnt be converted to a RB and Adnan couldnt take Young current position. One of our strongest part of the game is how well we isolate the wing backs to one and one situations. If we had someone that could either cross or beat a man from these sotuations instead of Valencia, it would add a lot more to our game.

3151~~~
I think he's done a remarkable job playing as a Right-back this season, especially considering that he isn't a defender, and has spent his career playing very direct and forward. I think people have underrated him and his commitment by playing there all season - as a lot of players would have said "Screw that, that's not my position, I'll go elsewhere". He's done a solid job for us and hope that he finds a decent club next season because even though he's done a job, he is no right back and we need to sign a good one in the summer. Wouldn't mind him as a squad player for the wings either - offers a great work rate, strength and pace coming off the bench.

3152~~~
He has been very good this season overall but he's also been terrible these past few games.

3153~~~
Started well yesterday and had Zaha in his pocket. I think he got skinned once, but there was a reason why Zaha had to switch sides. Valencia was just much faster and stronger; the amount of times he simply ran past Zaha was ridiculous, and he used it to his advantage going forwards also. In the second half he was much more anonymous. He is caught up the pitch a few times, no doubt.

3154~~~
A new right back should be a priority in the next window. Our right side will just be so much more effective with someone who can use the space and opportunities that Mata and Herera create. If we cant sign a player like that than even a RB who does nothing but defend well would be an improvement and should be considered. 

Tony should be a squad player next year

3155~~~
Except that is his position now, he has been playing there as early as 2012, we have to stop pretending he is just filling in and accept that's his position now, and more importantly that he isn't good enough to be right back for United, not even close. Its a shame because he seems like a top bloke but he's cost us far too often this season.

3156~~~
He was out of position so many times yesterday. It's critical that we buy an actual RB.

3157~~~
Those are his biggest strengths. I've said it before, but his physical attributes are brilliant for a defender. He is so, so hard to beat 1v1. It's just his poor defensive brain that lets him down (as well as his ability going forward). If LvG can continue to work at him then he could turn him into a good fullback. But does he have the capacity to still learn and develop at his age?

3158~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> For the love of all that's good in this world. What's the next level after clutching at straws? If his current standard of "crossing" is considered "improved" then Kyle Walker should be playing for Barca. 

Btw. Anyone saw how Coleman played this weekend? I wish.

3159~~~
I think (like several other players eg Blind) that he is mentally exhausted (not necessarily physically) - they are all on edge and the 3 loss run increases the stress - some are playing for their Utd careers and 4th is a must. The entire team's form has plummeted the past month.

3160~~~
It's only his position this year - in Fergie's last year he only played there when Rafael was injured (which wasn't half as much as now) and under Moyes he still played wing mostly including our pummeling of Bayer Leverkeusen.

3161~~~
Its his position now, he's more of a right back than he is a winger but it doesn't matter because he isn't good enough in either position.

3162~~~
His poorest spell this season by far. Utterly disgusting against Everton esp. Gets too much far too much slack for Palace game, though.

3163~~~
i was having a perfectly good day... why'd this thread have to be bumped?

3164~~~
Do you think its a blip or a return to the norm?

3165~~~
He has done well so far today.

3166~~~
great first half from him

3167~~~
Keeping sanchez quiet and getting forwards well.

3168~~~
I'm fully expecting the anti-Valencia brigade to slate an over-hit pass or something. 

Very good half for Tony. Linked well with Herrera and Mata.

3169~~~
Probably his best half of football in few months. Good stuff.

3170~~~
hmm - can't remember any great offensive ball of note.
Defensively shaky as usual....meh - story of his season (and career of late!)

3171~~~
Was defensively solid. People praise him for linking up well with Herrera and Mata; while that it true, it is a bad sign for us because that is all we can do on the right. If he doesn't rely on them, there's no way he's getting any room for himself or beating his man.

3172~~~
Sanchez barely touched the ball. How was he defensively shaky?

3173~~~
Not only were his crosses beating the first man but they good balls in. But being the depressive sort it just made me lament the player he has become where those sort of offensive contributions are a rarity rather than the norm like it used to be.

Still think we should sell him but at least today was a very good performance from him in all facets of his game.

3174~~~
I gave him an 8. Maybe a bit generous to put him next to Young and Herrera but he was left all alone on that right flank, against their most dangerous player, and stood his ground all game. We got much more problems down the left.

3175~~~
At least he tried to put in a few more crosses today. Still not enough for me though. Its a shame because our strikers are just so starved of service.

3176~~~
Strong performance today after a couple of shaky games.

3177~~~
Thought he was brilliant, though his crossing still isn't good enough.

Should provide decent cover for our next RB.

3178~~~
He was OK today I think. Kept it tidy at the back but offered feck all from his crosses.

3179~~~
Class today IMO. Completely kept their best player quiet and got forward to good effect as well. Was like a Valencia of old performance, reliable, consistent, and getting past his man all the time.

3180~~~
Good game but what is with the outside of the boot crosses when he has the opportunity to use the inside of his right foot to curl a ball into the box?

3181~~~
The trouble with Tony isn't as a defender, although he isn't top quality there either. Its his one dimensionality, his predictable one footed schtick that defenders know is coming each time. Hope we keep him as a utility/squad player next year behind whoever is going to be bought on the right.

3182~~~
I thought he did well, again, the issue is everytime you begin to think he's looking a decent player for the RB spot... the next game he costs a goal, I like the physicality he brings, it's quite staggering he looks so limited attack-wise from RB despite playing a few hundred games as a winger.

3183~~~
Did well defensively - some good tackles, interceptions and even offensively he had a few crosses causing problems including one fellaini headed straight, another Fellaini  set up Ander on his left and a third that ended up with RvP blazing over. Found Fellaini at least 3-4 times at the back post and Sanchez had one chance all game 9which he blazed over).

3184~~~
Thought he decent yesterday, kept Sanchez quiet for the most part which was much better than the FA Cup game. Should definitely stick around as back up to a new RB.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Today is the day that just keeps on giving. Only need DDG to sign to make it complete.

3190~~~
Fastest player in Europe, apparently. Anyone surprised?

3191~~~
I don't understand.

3192~~~
No, physically he's a beast. Undoubted athleticism.

3193~~~
I'll try to explain:
When Valencia moves his legs to create forward movement whilst carrying the ball, he does so faster than any other footballer. I'm not that surprised that he's at least as fast as Bale, as I see him a little overrated in that aspect. It does make it a little bit more frustrating why Valencia does not simply run past players instead of stopping to a standstill waiting for something...

3194~~~
He does that but he is so one dimensional at doing it that defenders figure it out even before he figures out he'll do it.

3195~~~
Overrated yet 2nd on the list.
I think you meant to say you think Valencia is underrated on that aspect.

3196~~~
Rooney was on that list too just behind Messi but quicker than Robben.

3197~~~
Well, people speak of Bale as he is out of this world in terms of speed, but Valencia is just as fast and has always been. That run that Bale made against Busquets is fantastic, but Nani pulled out a more impressive run against a defender this season. You are right though that Valencia is a little underrated in that aspect. Scholes thought he had lost a little pace... maybe on the first yard or so

3198~~~
He's figured on those lists time and time again actually. What baffles me about Rooney is that he can sometimes display that kind of pace, especially with the ball where he will just bomb through, on counter attacks in particular. At other times, he just looks pedestrian.

3199~~~
He often has a really poor touch when he kicks it forward in that he seems to kick it too far right, making it easy for the defender to get back into the game even though he is slower due to having to run a shorter distance. On defensive runs, a player like Aguero looked stationary. He also had Sanchez in his pocket for pace and toyed with Clichy even though Clichy was at full pelt, Valencia started behind him and had to accelerate.

3200~~~
Probably because there is more to speed when taking on your man. He limits him severely by being one footed. At full tilt he'd probably breeze past a defender if he had space ahead, but if we're trying to build up play, he'll always go for the cut back after being pushed out wide because they show him on his only foot. Then our play becomes congested on the right because you have him cutting inside on his RIGHT foot when Mata and Herrera are already in similar positions.

3201~~~
Its that split hesitation in the attacking areas that's so annoying to watch. You just can't afford to take your time because not only will the fullback get in front of him but it lets the midfielders that track back double up on the likes of Rooney and Fellani when they are in the box as well. Its been going on for so long now that I don't see him changing his style of play anytime soon.

Doubt he will leave in the summer as Rafael looks more likely go. I just hope we can get someone in who is better than Valencia in attacking sense but can defend just as good. Basically the perfect RB which is not asking for alot. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3202~~~
This fantastic run was against Chile in a qualifier in late 2013.  Really shows his acceleration with the ball.  Also note he was playing in central midfield that match which was away against a tough Chile side.  Despite the loss the goal was hugely important because of goal differential.

3203~~~
He's not. He's one of the fastest though.

3204~~~
He should have become an Ecuadorian sprinter then

3205~~~
It obviously also depends on form. Some days you are faster than others, just like sprinters. Depends on so many things, but as you say he is amongst the fastest.

3206~~~
Am I the only one who thinks he could be sort of a Ramires player for us? With his work rate, dynamism, pace, strength, composure he could be a very good b2b back up. He was very good vs Evertok earlier in the season, in midfield.

3207~~~
Football 365 described him as "Rugby League's gift to football" and it's spot on.

3208~~~
Some of his best performances that I've watched for Ecuador have come from a loose central midfield position. Also if you've ever watched them, it's weird to see how much better he looks technically than the rest. It's a complete role reversal to club life.

3209~~~
That defensive header <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3210~~~
Stop it - it's his first forward pass. Give him some credit!

3211~~~
I think there were 2 uses of the left foot today! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3212~~~
Can't be a starter next season. Despite his great physical attributes he so rarely uses his pace to attack the oppositions full back, even when he does his crosses are dreadful.

3213~~~
Defensively I thought he did pretty well again today, but I couldnt keep the motivation to continue looking up at the TV for most of the game, perhaps I missed something.

3214~~~
Someone need to gif that crazy cross where he just smashed it in a "feck this" manner.

3215~~~
Consistent 7 out of 10, in my opinion. The pace he shown when Blind played him a through ball was amazing.

3216~~~
He was good today by Valencia standards.  Never mind the fact that Hull could play without a LB and he still wouldn't make a decent ball in.

3217~~~
For a winger, he's quite poor at times, especially with the ball at his feet. 4 times out of 5 he plays the ball backwards

3218~~~
A player who's played out of position has been generally very decent. Really not fair to judge him with other full-backs. 

6/10

3219~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-right-back-antonio-valencia-9329084?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...r-united-right-back-antonio-valencia-9329084?</a>

Had surgery today, nature of injury unknown.

3220~~~
He's been decent but he does tend to give away a lot of unnecessary free kicks which we end up conceding from. We need to get a proper right back. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3221~~~
I hope it's a cure for his inept crossing ability.

3222~~~
Probably needed to get his left foot looked at as he used it twice yesterday, it's not used to such a strenuous workout.

3223~~~
Wasn't he rated as the 4th best fullback in the world or Europe this season in that Football ratings thing? Some organization starting with C.

He's been a pretty solid option at the back, dont remember many games where he's struggled defensively.. Has made some mistakes but overall has been a reliable, 6-7/10 player most games..

3224~~~
Left leg transplant?

3225~~~
Fingers crossed its a brain transplant.

3226~~~
I wish him a quick recovery. Valencia has been very dependable this season, and it seems this procedure was pushed back to the end of the season. Very brave guy, probably our toughest player. A real hero.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://thepeoplespersonimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/26040525/valencia.png" src="http://thepeoplespersonimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/26040525/valencia.png"/>

3227~~~
Lots of Valencia hate both in the RC awards and the Alves thread. Is that the consensus? I think he's really grown into the role this season and been quite good most of the time. I'd be fine with no RB and sticking with Valencia and Rafa. Am I alone?

3228~~~
Would have no problem seeing him in midfield. Hate him outwide

3229~~~
Not anywhere near versatile enough for the first XI as we have to look at offering more going forward, but more than a decent cover at RW.

It's incredible how long he's been played out of position. Always gave 100%, even with no real competition for "his" position. I'm confident LVG will keep him, and trust him again next season (hopefully not as first-choice RB!).

3230~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3231~~~
I love him, he is limited but he gives everything all the time and he was lethal in his prime.

3232~~~
No, I agree. I quite like Valencia at RB.

A new specialist RB would obviously be ideal, but I'm not complaining if we start next season with Tony there again.

3233~~~
Nope. We really should go out and sign a RB.

3234~~~
Apparently he's having some "screws" removed from his knee left behind from his 2010 operation. Ecuador apparently weren't expecting the news. It puts him out of the Copa America which starts in 2 weeks.

He had it done now to be ready for our pre-season, according to AS.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://chile.as.com/chile/2015/05/26/futbol/1432599367_651179.html" target="_blank">http://chile.as.com/chile/2015/05/26/futbol/1432599367_651179.html</a>

3235~~~
0:13-0:16 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3236~~~
That's terrific news, instead of playing in the Copa and then doing it.

3237~~~
Good news

Not that most of our spastic fans will appreciate that

3238~~~
Interesting. I wonder how much that's been hindering him, physically? 

He was great in his first few months back playing after the leg break but this might be one of those delayed complications that only started caused problems a year or two down the line.

3239~~~
Having had screws in my knee before it's a dull always-there pain. Hopefully it might explain the mental block he's had in attacking for large parts of the past 3 years and that a full recovery will see a more direct Antonio Valencia in attack again whether at RB or RW (backup).

3240~~~
Think he was pretty awful against Arsenal in the cup as I remember it but otherwise he's been pretty solid this year. A much better right back than he was a year or two ago.

3241~~~
He had a howler vs Arsenal and Everton but otherwise he's been fine and will be a good backup to a proper quality RB.

3242~~~
Is that Albert Stroller from Hustle with him?

3243~~~
Every time I think about Valencia I'm impressed he had a good season in a position that isn't his and he improved all season long, at 29 years old. I though that Juanfran was special but Valencia is also an impressive character.

3244~~~
Every time I think about him, I wonder how much he can bench and how many push ups he can make.

3245~~~
I wasnt impressed and disagree that he had a good season. He was decent at best with ups and downs but was a big reason why we looked so shaky. You couldnt have counted how often he was out of position. He shouldnt be more than a back up player next season

3246~~~
I guess its just what we expect of him now. The days of him beating his defender and putting a good cross in are gone. But if you want someone who is solid and can defend at fall back there are few better in our squad. (Even with his mistake against Asnl)

3247~~~
The amount of players who should only be back-ups next season means that we're not even going to have a first team at this rate.

3248~~~
true, but if you asked me which one of our current first team regulars should be a backup next season, I'd say Valencia every single time.

The only other 2 I'd have as near definite backups would be Fellaini and Young.

3249~~~
Except he wasn't solid, he looked OK when we were dominating teams possession wise because we had very little defending to do. He was guilty of some very poor defending through the season and big lapses in concentration.

3250~~~
I think for the most part he was. Its easy to have a distorted view by a few mistakes through the season but on the whole there was a reason why he kept Rafael out of the side

3251~~~
Perhaps, although its equally likely to have a distorted view based on teams overall performance and not on individual ones. He kept Rafael out because Rafael couldn't keep himself fit and LVG thought consistency was the key at the end of the season. Still, this has been discussed to death with two clear camps.

3252~~~
Can't cross for anything which isn't good enough for a winger or a RB, but he was fine defensively.

3253~~~
Will be a decent back up RB next season. Also didn't LVG refer to him as 'the best player in the Arsenal game making a mistake' in his end of the season awards speech?

3254~~~
Can't cross, doesn't take on players anymore despite his searing pace, not great in the air and defensively suspect. Apart from that he's grand.

3255~~~
Yes I noticed that as well.

3256~~~
He did. Highly rated by SAF, LvG and Pep Guardiola. What is it people are missing in their assessment of his value to the squad?

3257~~~
Lots of my mates rate him. I always say he isn't that good and we are looking for replacements and they laugh.

3258~~~
One of the first decisions from Louie when he arrived was to offer him a contract. It wasn't a bad decision since Rafael is in recovery state but with first legit RB signing coming here he's benched and then maybe rotated in the cups.

The good news is he never complains about one thing therefore he's staying as a depth player who can easily get solid amount of games in case of injury storm.

You just know we're going to play him at some point no matter what.

3259~~~
The rating by Ferguson was from when he played without fear and at the same time had the tag of Mr. Reliable and will do the job asked. Pep's backing was also when Valencia was having one of this best season. The times when he was tearing Ashley Cole a new one. As far as LVG goes, LVG likes players that do what he asks and are reliable.

As supporters though I'd say most of us are looking for the Tony V. and not turn back Tony. And obviously there are quite a few that still are upset he was bought to fill the right wing spot after Ronaldo and demand an almost like for like replacement even though he has given us very good service.

I also do think people just don't value the players like the Valencia's Parks, O'Sheas etc - who are not glamorous but, are integral to a teams success during the year. I think he gives us a great squad option but, would nice if at this point he wasn't the shoe in first XI option.

3260~~~
Who do you think are Barca's and Real Madrid's version of Valencia/John O'Shea?

3261~~~
Some valid points. I tend to condemn his worst critics as butthurt Ronaldo fanbois. It'll be interesting to see if he'll improve after having the screws removed from his leg.

3262~~~
Who did Madrid have coming off the bench against Juve to save them? Chicharito - a player deemed surplus to us this season. The grass is not always greener. Barca in their recent history have had one of the greatest players and two of the best central midfielders of the generation playing behind him. However, even they looked wanting in games when some of their role players could not step up.

You come across as one of those that simply expect a world XI for every team and if they are not then they are just not good enough. When in truth great teams are made by a combination of great players and by role players such as the Busquets, Pedros and the likes. United's problem right now has not been the likes of Valencia does not belong but, more that the players we expect great things from have not delivered - the likes Rooney, RVP, Falcao, ADM. Valencia has done the job more or less that has been expected out of him. Which is why managers keep playing him.

3263~~~
I think you're taking the piss if you really think Busquets is just a role player.

3264~~~
So just to clarify, you don't know.

I should come across as someone who thinks Manchester United should be competing with Barca and Madrid, not accepting mediocrity within our squad. Quite simply the reason why you couldn't give me the Barca version of O'Shea or Valencia is because they haven't got one. Busquets is the best defensive midfielder of his generation, Pedro just a few weeks ago scored a spectacular overhead kick, these are players of real quality who are technically brilliant. 

This 'do a job' mentality has to stop, its small time.

3265~~~
Under Guardiola and Villanova it was Adriano, Bayern it's Rode, for Chelsea Ramires, City has Milner.

3266~~~
I think he did a good job defensively this season actually. Sure, there were times his positioning cost us a goal but this happens to recognised full-backs aswell. It just gets magnified when it happens to somebody playing out of their natural position.

Going forward though, his crossing is a serious frustration. Especially when playing behind Mata who drifts inside.

3267~~~
Really? You think they are acceptable comparisons? Adriano and Rode or Valencia and O'Shea...

3268~~~
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to answer but Valencia and O'Shea played at a higher level.

3269~~~
Yet Fergie dominated domestically and was second only to one of the best teams ever in Europe with John O'Shea an almost guaranteed starter when fit. Go figure.

3270~~~
Isn't that Mathieu bloke basically the Barca equivalent of John O'shea anyway? Regardless I don't think a comparison between O'Shea and Valencia is apt. While Valencia is willing to be versatile and play full back he is shaky there and makes us vulnerable. Sheasy would guarantee you defensive solidity if not much else, but a guarantee of defensive solidity was splendid for a versatile squad player.

3271~~~
And Obertan played at a higher level than Matt Le Tissier.

Rode is 24 and is considered by many to be Schweinsteigers heir.
Cleverley was also a pivotal player under Fergie toward the end of his career, should we bring him back as well? Think we should avoid continued comparisons to O'Shea anyway as its derailing the thread and he was at least very versatile (which AV isnt). 

So again who are Barca's and Madrid current Valencia?

3272~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> Valencia and O'Shea have individually played at a high level, I'm not talking about the environment but about their performances.

3273~~~
The Valencia of a bygone era was brilliant, he isn't even close to that now. I think we should leave O'Shea out of this as its derailing the thread a little and he at least has the skill of being extremely versatile. Valencia isn't that. He's an average full back and a mediocre winger. He shouldnt be anywhere near the starting XI if we have serious aspirations of challenging in Europe.

3274~~~
What needs to stop is the thought that the only way to compete is having world XI players through the team when that is not the case and not something that can be maintained unless bank rolled - by a bank. Madrid tried their galacticos that has failed. City, PSG have been met with the same fate.

So Pedro scored a spectacular free kick, that makes him brilliant? No what has made him so good is that he has done the job along side some great players. It's why Barca keep buying other forwards even though they have him - because while he is not the best he is a very good player much like Valencia that helps make a team.

What is small time is people like you that tend to not give players like Valencia their due. No one is saying he is what we should build our team around but, he is not the type of player we want to be without either. Players like him is what has made United great over the years along side some exceptional players.

3275~~~
Who said that he should be in our starting eleven? He had a good season in a position alien to him, that's worthy of praises, there is no subliminal message.

3276~~~
Think he did quite well in some of the big games, Anfield, City at home.  Sure he went to sleep on occasion too but Zabaleta for example, slept through most of the season.  He's a good guy that's done an alien job to a 7/10 standard, in most games.  I just don't see where the upgrade is coming from.  I don't believe Alves will come & Clyne doesn't grab me as a particular upgrade defensively or, Coleman either.  Maybe there is a 'find' out there in Europe somewhere.

3277~~~
I used to be a massive Valencia fan but I'm past the point of trying to defend him. To go from a Man Utd number 7 and player of the year to a stop gap fullback is one of the biggest declines I can remember. Rooney gets stick for not being up there with Messi whilst you still have people who continually set the bar lower and lower for Valencia. 

I'll give him the benefit of the doubt as a RB but he's dodgy positional and is very guilty of ball watching. And I think his lack of willingness to overlap at pace is stopping us breaking down teams. Arsenal had their full backs bombing beyond the ball at pace creating space on the weekend. Valencia is too content to backup the play, slow it down & not aggressively attack the space Mata leaves for him. Means we have no penetration on the right. Compare that to Blind at LB and Shaw vs Chelsea and the link up play with Young.

3278~~~
Arbeloa for Real. Far worse than Valencia and O'Shea.

3279~~~
It's nice to have mind readers around the place.

3280~~~
I've heard LVG say he was our best player (as in MOTM) on a couple of occasions so I doubt it was just about him keeping fit.

3281~~~
Who's the answer to the RB quandry? 

<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

3282~~~
A fit Rafael

3283~~~
He should really commit to his new role and try to learn more and improve over the summer. There's a world class Right back in there somewhere but he's too new to the role to already show that on a consistent basis. His defensive awareness is still iffy and honestly his crossing just needs to come back to where it was before.

3284~~~
No, its common sense. He made no unforced changes to his starting XI for about 6 games despite keys players returning from injury.
He said it after the game when Valencia literally gave the ball to Welbeck to make it 2-1, he was protecting his player.
Why is the bar being lowered again for Valencia? And this isn't an alien position, he's played there for years (he played there under Fergie) and its now considered his actual position.
Really? Because concurrently Madrid and Barca are without their 'do a job' players in their current starting XI and still no one has been able to name one in their current sides.

Pedro isn't in the side because he's behind Suarez, Messi and Neymar they keep buying forwards because they want to improve, he's still a fantastic player but they have strength in depth. Pedro isn't a converted right back who can do a job further forward, that's the difference. 

You really seem to be misinterpreting support players as average players. The fact you compared Valencia to Busquets says it all really.

3285~~~
Even at the awards function? There is defending and then there is going overboard with it.

3286~~~
I don't think we can take anything away from that night...

3287~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Why would he mention it drunk if he didn't think it?

He also replaced Herrera, who was actually our best player, with Blind and lost control of that game. Let's just agree that his judgement, drunk or otherwise, isn't very sound when it comes to that game.

3288~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fair point.

3289~~~
Blatant agendas against Van Gaal/Valencia aside, those comments were fair. Apart from that horrendous error Valencia had had a decent game, in a game where very few United players performed at a decent level. Wouldn't expect the usual suspects to recognise that but there you go.

3290~~~
Spot on, I think he should be our first choice RB next year with Rafael as backup. He's had some solid displays this season and some iffy ones too. If he gets his head down pre season and really studies the role he can make it his own. He's rarely injured and an absolute physical beast.

3291~~~
Probably the way it's going to go, now that the Clyne move has chilled.  We see lots of complaining about our two RB's but fee logical suggestions of upgrades that are attainable.

3292~~~
To be honest i'm not sure there are many upgrades out there at the moment. World class right backs are in short supply. So i'd be happy for us to save the cash, (unless Rafael wants to leave) and strengthen elsewhere.  People have thrown names around like Coleman, Clyne, Carvajal etc but are they even considered an upgrade? Valencia wants to be here, he's loyal and I think deserves the position on performance.

3293~~~
Yep, many complain about Valencia/Rafael but few come up with any other names than those you list & I agree, they're not worth the outlay for the supposed gain, IF, they are indeed available & willing to come here in the first place.

3294~~~
Its a horrendous error, you can't ignore things like that and say he played well. I don't expect the usual agenda driven suspects to recognise that though blah blah blah

3295~~~
Who should we get in at RB?

3296~~~
All the defensive positions need years to adapt, they are not based on talent but on experience and instinct, you don't become a right back after 10 games in 10 years. And the bar isn't lowered for Valencia as a right back, he had a good season, just compare his season to the rest of the top 10 right backs.

3297~~~
Correct, not many better, in the Prem.

3298~~~
How can anyone say he's had a good season really when he's made around 5 horrendous blunders.

Valencia has basically had a season comparative to Evra's worse a couple of seasons ago (with the same slow walking back) but even then Evra actually contributed going forward. 

Under Fergie and Moyes he was a disaster in defence, now he's improved to poor. Are we really expecting him to step up to become a right back suitable for a title chasing side?

3299~~~
Who expects that?

As for your comparative, comparing a winger with a world class left back veteran is unfair, Valencia starting the season wasn't a right back.

3300~~~
Alternatives please.

3301~~~
Clyne, Coleman, we should've been interested in Darmian. Alves would still be a big upgrade.


Nonsense, you still need to have a huge amount of talent to be a class defender. The club nor the player have the time for him to learn how to play right back.

3302~~~
You are debating alone here, I didn't asked for him to be a starter next season, I didn't even hinted that. As for the talent part who said that you didn't need talents at all? What I said is that it's not based on that, it's based on using the information/experience gained in training and games, and use it to adjust the positioning, the anticipation, the marking in already experienced situations. Defenders improve trough mistakes and the remembering of the said mistakes.

You can't expect from a 29 years old winger that he plays like a veteran fullback.

3303~~~
That's fine JP but you originally quoted me not the other way around, I'm glad we both agree he isn't good enough to be starting for us, which means he needs replacing.

I don't expect him to be able to play like a right back now, that's my point, this isn't a personal thing against Valencia, i'm disagreeing with those who beleive he is good enough to be our rightback.

3304~~~
True, and I responded to your question by naming squad players in big clubs, which I though would be explicit enough. But you want him replaced so much, that you didn't noticed.<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

3305~~~
Alves - can't see it happening.

Clyne talks broke down or LVG agreed with most that he's not a significant (if at all), improvement.  Like Coleman, his main strength going forward.   Now if you want a defensive improvement Darmain would be worth an enquiry - have we backed out?  IF, Munich are in for him, then forget it - even Arsenal & London), might seem a better option to us for the Italian.  It's easy to spit out names - getting them is a different matter. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3306~~~
Ah see I didn't get that, Sim and Pogue were talking about them being actual starters, hence why I thought you were following suit. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

I dunno, I think a decent offer to Alves and we will get his attention. I think you're right about Darmian though he does seem set for Bayern but we do know Bayern have a strict wage policy so if he's motivated by money we could still turn his head. I think we are going to have to again over spend on players this season, once we've reestablished ourselves as a top dog in Europe negotiations might become a little easier.

3307~~~
Shows just how un straight forward replacing Valencia is.

3308~~~
Of course It's unfair on him as we shouldn't have that expectation on a declining winger but if he's going to play there then we have to hold him to the standards we expect.

It's not really the managers fault either as he didn't have that many choices and sadly Valencia isn't even the winger he was.

3309~~~
No, we shouldn't judge his past season as if he was an elite fullback, he is a decent squad player who had a good season and we should judge his season as the squad player that he is. Now, we can expect or wish to sign someone potentially better.

3310~~~
Of course the players you mentioned would be a bloody upgrade. This is a player who these days offers zero going forward, refuses to take on a man when he does get in a threatening position, can't cross his legs, is suspect defensively and you are saying we cannot get an upgrade? I've never before come across a player that some fans are willing to drop the bar year on year to justify his performances but with Valencia it is unreal.

3311~~~
I didn't compare their ability - I compared their worth to the team as not star players but, those that deliver when called upon. But, that concept seems above you.

3312~~~
This.

3313~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You originally call Valencia a squad option, then you compare him to Busquets and  Pedro, one of which is a guaranteed starter and the other is a different type of player completely, he just happens to have the best forward line in the world in front of him. To go back to my point, you're confusing Valencia who 'does a job' for the team with Busquets, who is world class player in a supporting role and Pedro who would walk into pretty much any team in the world. They're different things.

Anyway we are digressing so let's just agree to disagree.

3314~~~
Yeah, considering Valencia used to be a winger, it's mind boggling that he so shite at the attacking aspect of the fullback position. I can understand if it's the defensive part of the role, but he looks absolutely clueless going forward

3315~~~
It's funny how you guys don't rate Valencia at all. He's a solid performer and his presence alone has prevented us getting trainwrecked for a couple seasons now.
And the talk about offering zero going forward, pffft. For example the first goal in the MUN-LIV game this season was the nicest goals by us I've seen in a while.

3316~~~
Roosney off the top of your head, list 9 other assists by Valencia <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> See, that is the thing. You give one example. Someone of his ability, should be able to cross without hitting the first defender.

3317~~~
That's ridiculous. In fact, he's one of the reasons why we have down the gutter with his decline combined to his lack of technical ability. What's even more baffling has been how none of our last 3 managers has had the guts to tell him to forget a place in the starting lineup or simply that he's not part of the short term future anymore.

I hope we sign a new RB while using Varela as a backup for that position next season. The further I see Valencia from the main squad, the better several fans will feel. Enough with this conundrum already.

3318~~~
He was positionally atrocious in that game long before that error, I remember the gaping hole through which Sanchez and co. kept walking into our box, including for the 1st goal, and of course he handed them the second.

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/antonio-valencia-2014-15-performances.395263/page-53#post-17225354">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/antonio-valencia-2014-15-performances.395263/page-53#post-17225354</a>

3319~~~
Nah. Disagree. But really can't be arsed revisiting that particular argument. It was done to death at the time.

3320~~~
He's a manager's dream. No ego, follows instructions, no agent, won't fuss if I  the bench, keeps his game simple, and is stronger and faster than 99% of attackers.

I'm good with him and Rafael at RB. Just hope that LVG ops for Rafael if he is fit.

3321~~~
If Valencia is following instructions we have bigger problems than his selection

3322~~~
He is following instruction, he's just not very good at executing it.

3323~~~
I think this is really unfair.  Taking on players unnecessarily is one of the fundamentals of van gaals methods.  Its one of the reasons he has had such poor relations with Brazilian players because its a core part of its approach. 

If our defence doesnt keep possesion it is almost nigh on impossible for the rest of them to keep possesion.  

The same goes for needless shots and crossing not only because it wastes possesion; but also because we dont evem have the right strikers to utilise this tactic. 

We want our approach to attacking and defending both to be team co-ordinated; as such valencia's performances have been better suited to van gaals team than either SAF's or Moyes's.

At his age; there is almost no reason to replace him with another attacking fullback because he just wont have the ability to play with commin sense that valencia has in abundance.

3324~~~
Not talking about any of that. He goes wandering way out of position with no gain to the team and exposing our right side in the process.

If Valencia is just following orders, then LVG is the questionable one.

3325~~~
Valencia is a backup right back. Simply not good enough for a club that wants to win trophies. Good squad player.

3326~~~
That's simply untrue. Being limited and not a proper right back, doesn't mean you have more common sense than others. Dani Alves is on a different planet as a fullback, and Valencia doesn't trump him on some arbitrary common sense index. He's just inferior, in almost every way.

Like I said, Valencia's alright. He can have good games, can do a decent job, always works hard. But this club should have fullbacks like Evra, Gary Neville etc, not Valencia, as the starting right back.

3327~~~
Because Valencia is the bench mark for how great a RB should be?

3328~~~
Imagine if we had gotten Dani Alves. So much common sense on the bench <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3329~~~
I would say that dani alves is the only RB who can attack and defend with common sense.  The likes of coleman and rafael are complete live-wires compared to valencia.  
 Being a live-wire full back was once the way to go under SAF; but now we are a possesion based team and a live wire full back is not best suited to it.

3330~~~
Thats assuming that everybody seems to want to replace valencia with a more attacking fullback when a very few people see the benefits of a defensive minded RB; like carjaval or even van gaals indication of using mcnair as a RB.

3331~~~
Just because you are an attacking FB does not mean you cannot defend for toffees. Someone like Coleman would provide both and be better than Valencia in both those traits.

3332~~~
People don't want a more attacking fullback they want a quality fullback. They tend to be better in most areas relevant to that position than Valencia.

3333~~~
According to who?  Coleman is a marginal improvement on valencia.  Valencia is not a great RB; but is able to play under instruction something coleman's game is not made out to do.  Coleman in particular is a bombshell on the right hand side and although it might sound appealing; we dont play with any attacking ariel threats these days to utilise his crosses.  

It's one thing if moyes bought coleman but its a totally different style of play to what van gaals possesion teams are built on. 

Van gaal did say that Mcnair could be our RB for the next 10 years; which part of that screams out to you that we are in need of an attacking fullback?

3334~~~
The bold part is an absolute imagination from you. You dont have the first clue if Coleman is someone who can play under instructions. Just because he has a good attacking presence does not mean he is meandering forward against instructions. Everton are a mid-table side and Coleman has had to do a lot of defending and he has done that much better than Valencia who is positionally all over the place most of the time. Even in that Everton game, he went to sleep and let Mirallas through on goal. That is not the sign of a man who has "common sense".

As for VG saying McNair could be our RB, from his history his record in the market is very questionable. He didn't want Neuer if reports are to be believed. As for whether he wants an attacking RB or not, all that can be said is there are better options out there who would be an improvement on Valencia.

And I find it funny that you say "according to who" when people claim Coleman is much better than Valencia but in the next statement state that Coleman is a marginal improvement and put it as if it is to be treated as a fact.

3335~~~
He is marginal improvent because he plays for a team which utilises his strengths.  The same way fellaini is a much better fit for everton still even more than for united.  The fact is that out of our 4 fullbacks last season; the better two were the more defensive minded fullbacks in blind &  valencia.  Shaw &  rafael through injury or not were hardly influential. 

If people wanted coleman because he so so far superior to valencia defensively  then i'd question why we wouldn't purchase the likes of carjaval,  ramos and other defensive RB's. 

Most of our fans are stuck in this attacking fullback nonsense when teams like chelsea &  city have perfectly capable defensive RB's in ivanovic &  zabaleta. Not only do they keep possesion better but they play with common sense which is fundamental to possesion football.

3336~~~
What on earth are you talking about? How is Valencia classed as a defensive minded fullback, and Shaw not so when Shaw has shown natural defensive qualities despite his young age and Valencia continues to clearly lack some defensive skills, even though he's a very experienced player in his prime?

3337~~~
A mid table team with an awful defensive record.

3338~~~
At the start of the season no one here would have even suggested he should be our RB. Have his performances this season been upto the standard to convince otherwise? 

90% is just stand still and pass it to another player stood 5 yards away. He walks back slowly when the opposition attacks. I'm not sure I've ever seen him correctly push a winger wide whilst defending as he's never been in that position it's always Smalling who comes across. 

Our RB should be able to offer at least something beyond the basics whether that's great crossing, speed on the counter, beating a man or great defending.  

The high rating of Valencia at RB on here recently by some is the strangest thing I've experienced on here since joining . I just don't get it.

3339~~~
Valencia is bang average defensively. I just pointed out one huge mistake from him, yet you keep on ranting about how good he is defensively and how much more "common sense" he has compared to other attacking RBs out there. How the heck do you measure his common sense vis-a-vis someone like Coleman?

Also the point about Everton utilizing Coleman's strengths, that is what teams do. Utilize the strengths of their players. Also, Valencia is being utilized as a defensive RB in our system and he is still just about OK there.

3340~~~
Our attacking record was average last season but can it be attributed to just one player?

3341~~~
No but they all play their part. Coleman's game stands out because he scored a few goals. I don't think he's a particularly good defender.

3342~~~
He may not be a Gary Neville in defense but he is better than Valencia, IMO.

3343~~~
This is what i mean by common sense.  90% of the team stop running and pass the ball to the best positioned player.  The only reason valencia is brutalised for doing so is that we know that he does it because he isnt able to take someone on from his time as a winger.  

So buying someone who can take someone on is a worthless expenditure when nearly all of the team are taught to not lose possesion needlessly.  Furthermore as gary neville commented after our win vs liverpool &  city is that our defense is compact with almost no natural width.  How exactly is coleman going to be great on the wide positions if we dont play to our width.  Thats why van gaal sees a future in Mcnair because he can be a centrally orientated RB with thr ability to dribble heads up.  The same goes for blind and unfortunately shaw will have a lot of adapting to do but has time on his side. 

The only time van gaal gives any sort of freedom is to the wingers himself.  The likes of depay, young,   di maria (winger)  are instructed to take the opposition on.  Infact it's probably di maria's inability to do so that had him struggle towards the latter half of the season.

3344~~~
The grass isn't always greener. Some people here refuse to see any positive in Valencia at all. Most minds are made up before the game starts. I think people are in for a rude awakening if they think a player like Coleman is going to come here and revolutionise our right back position.

3345~~~
He wouldnt need to. He'd just need to not wander off leaving a 3 man defence for half the game

Its a very basic thing to ask

3346~~~
That is the problem with Valencia, and it is one of the reason's why a RB is needed, so we do not start leaking daft goals. Valencia did fit what was required last season, sometimes getting makesift players having to do a job there, now that VG does have a full summer, now is the time to strike it hot and get a RB who is specialized in that position. These are special summers, there is no world cup and European championships, so VG does have the freedom not waiting for players to return from duty. Because next summer is going to be awkward trying to get players in

3347~~~
Exactly.  The way our defence is organised is not made up for a full throttle attacking fullback.  We play so narrow at the back and expand widewards the further in attack we are. How coleman is going to be better than valencia at playing a completely un-natural game to either is what confuses me.  I can see why someone like ramos playing at RB is much better. 

People bring on valencia's past as a RW and expect him to bombard the flanks atleast with the same determination never mind success &  accuracy but it wont happen qhen the whole team is built on ball retention.

3348~~~
This is a post that actually makes a lot of sense but we don't really know how exactly LvG envisions next season's starting lineup. That's my only objection to what you wrote (i agree with the way you're thinking). You see, judging by last season's standards, Valencia was very important to van Gaal's plans. The very fact that the manager publicly defended him after the defensive error which led to Welbeck's goal in the FA Cup is, at least in my eyes, proof of that.

If we take a closer look to the squad LvG had to work with, we'll see that we didn't have enough options in the midfield, in terms of both quantity and quality, to connect the lines, improve our build up play and use possession to get players in more advanced positions. Our best option, Carrick, was out due to injury and in the beginning of the season we had to rely on Fletcher to do that. As the season progressed, Blind became an option but he still struggled to control the tempo and link up with others in the big games and away from home. LvG managed to turn Herrera into a proper #8 and when his passing in our half of the pitch reached higher standards, LvG even trusted him with Carrick's holding role when the latter got injured again. When we had both on the pitch, we played our best football in the season.

That's when Valencia comes into the picture. A player with a good first touch and pass n' move abilities, a player who can protect possession and most importantly he can carry the ball forward with safety. That's the main reason LvG trusted him on our right side no matter the starting formation. From that point of view it's true that Valencia was absolutely vital to LvG's attempts to build a possession based side.

On the other hand, this doesn't mean that the manager doesn't want a different kind of player at RB, if of course the right opportunity emerges. There's a notion among many United fans that possession football=attack through the middle which is false. As far as LvG is concerned, the Dutch 4-3-3, with reverse wingers and full backs providing width, is one of the basic principles of their playing style. In fact, we also used the wings to initiate attacking plays a lot during last season. And we really struggled from the fact that our opponents chose to defend in a very narrow shape simply because they expected no threats from our FBs' contribution in the final third.

Is Coleman the man for the job? Probably not but that doesn't mean we're not looking into the possibility of signing a different kind of RB, especially if we manage to improve our midfield options.

3349~~~
Im glad you bought the midfield up because the midfield is the reason i am talking about our fullbacks. 

Alot of our fans might think that our 352 approach is gone but aslong as we play the dutch 433, the 352 will remain a defensive formation we revert to when we have to defend.  The question is where do the fullbacks play?  Do they play on the sides of the pitch or centrally?  

The answer for me is when van gaal said we needed a box to box midfielder next to herrera who is probably the attacking version of the player van gaal wants.  There job is to be central and carry the ball forward centrally to then be in a position to have 3 potential attackers (rw, lw, cf)  to pass to.  

If our midfield is central we have to assume that most of the back line is central and our fullbacks are constantly switching between width & centrality.  

Thaf is why valencia has been good enough this season atleast not to be distraught over being replaced by another attacking minded fullback who purely focuses on width.  

Let's not forget that valencia has occasionally played in RDM for club &  country and this is important because this position allows the balance between wide fullback and central ability.  Likewise blind has the ability to play at LB aswell as LDM.  

Thats why i have an assumption that Mcnair is highly regarded by van gaal because judging by his positional career he has played as a defensive midfielder,  a right sided Cb and now a RB

3350~~~
Then I'm not sure Coleman is the man for the job.

3351~~~
agreed with the poster that said he'd be a 'marginal' upgrade to Valencia.

ps. why isn't Valencia on the transfer list btw, or will we freeze him out and wait till he is in the final year of his contract to try and obtain a cheeky £1.2m for him?

3352~~~
<a class="username" data-user="96090, @Santiago_KinderBueno" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/96090/">@Santiago_KinderBueno</a>

Agree with your analysis, i'm just thinking that a midfield of, let's say, Carrick-Schweinsteiger-Herrera, can potentially lead LvG in the decision to alter his plans a little bit. Especially if our starting LB next season is going to be Shaw, who is good at defending in 1v1 situations and can operate as third CB when the situation demands of him to do so. If we also assume that LvG is going to stick with tactics that include a holding midfielder (in a three man midfield), we have the numbers and the quality for a quick and well organized defensive transition.

If that's the case, i believe we can "afford" a more "gifted" full back in the final third. By saying that, i certainly don't mean a FB who will always stay wide and hug the touchline when he goes forward. But we could use an Alves type of player who can play an important role in the build up process, do underlaps as well as overlaps and has excellent short passing abilities. But i may be wrong and you're right about McNair and LvG's plans for his future role in the first team.

If that's not the case and we continue as we are, i don't see how anyone could argue with your analysis of how the FBs were interchanging during our games between central and wide positions. I also mentioned it in my previous post that this is why LvG trusted Valencia all season. It's actually amazing that if you check the per 90min. stats, Valencia is always among the three players with the most touches on the ball.

Furthermore, that's one the reasons why i still believe that, if we don't sign a new FB, we'll be seeing more of Blind at the LB position.

3353~~~
The drawn out analysis above is all well and good but Valencia has played the exact same way under Fergie and Moyes, his limited role isn't a complex aspect of the LvG philosophy its a product of his limited ability. 

What we do need is another question to be debated but the answer certainly isn't Antonio Valencia

3354~~~
The only way I can explain the inter-relations between our defenders and midfield is unfortunately to show formation graphs of relative positions taken up.

I will start with the 352- the defensive formation of the 433.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://sharemytactics.com/46382/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://sharemytactics.com/46382/Manchester-United-future-formation-tactics.png" src="http://sharemytactics.com/46382/Manchester-United-future-formation-tactics.png"/></a>

In this formation, our fullbacks protect our wider defensive midfield areas in turn allowing our central defensive midfielder (carrick/Schneirdlin) to guard the defence. Having the DM move around the width of the pitch keeps our CB's unprotected. However,  if our fullbacks are the one's who protect the wide areas up to the midfield line then that allows us to be stronger centrally because our CDM will be free to man mark any central threat.

Then the 433- the attacking formation does not need our DM to be a defender so we expand, both by width and length.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://sharemytactics.com/46384/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://sharemytactics.com/46384/Manchester-United-future2-formation-tactics.png" src="http://sharemytactics.com/46384/Manchester-United-future2-formation-tactics.png"/></a>

That is why width is still important but not at the mercy of the ability to play centrally. Our defenders are there to not only protect our goal but to provide balls to the midfield. A defender who is constantly out on the wide can only pass the ball to one or two midfielders while a centrally adept full back will have much more freedom to initiate the right pass to the most available midfielder.

We start off Narrow and then widen during attack, it's almost a way of making space in the opposition team by our own manipulation.

Some of our fans may have a heart attack at the thought but it wouldn't suprise me if van gaal started mcnair at RB during pre-season to see how well he has progressed.  Likewise shaw has pleanty of ability to stamp that LB spot as his own but neither are ready yet.

3355~~~
<a class="username" data-user="96090, @Santiago_KinderBueno" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/96090/">@Santiago_KinderBueno</a> after a time out, I actually think that when Shaw came back to the team at Stamford Bridge, he did show some encouraging progress towards the direction of being a wide defender who can contribute centrally. Did you see the same?

3356~~~
Why would he be? He's a useful player and managers trust him.

3357~~~
And yet they all played him every week. He's obviously doing something they like.

3358~~~
I always remember that match because of the vast majority on here that enjoyed that performance by him. If you look back at Van Gaal he didnt look all that pleased and it drew to me to be a potential problem that might arise in the future. We all like Rafael, Evra, Neville because they play with alot of heart, but the full back position is going to more vital for us; so that we dont necessarily bombard the wings and whip crosses in. It is a waste of possesion especially if we don't play with a striker like RVN or even Benteke.

If I had watched that match and pretended SAF was manager; I would be over the moon. However with Van gaal; I felt it was another performance which merely added to his potential rather than solidifying him as ready. He was central for brief parts (again because he is under instruction) but gave away needless balls and his running actually altered our team shape; which makes it that much harder to get the ball to vital positions.

The thing with Shaw is as <a class="username" data-user="82676, @TheRedDevil'sAdvocate" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82676/">@TheRedDevil'sAdvocate</a> said; he is actually capable territory wise to play narrow guard the central defense as well as be a wider fullback. I mean his height alone surprised me. To me his biggest problem is his natural ability to position himself and dribble with his head up. A player who runs with his head down will go in to the wider more empty spaces; while a player who dribbles with his head up will dribble towards the opposition and push the opposition bacl.

When you get a chance have a look at how Mcnair & Blind Dribble; not guts to the wall but heads up and calm. This allows them to always keep possession and ultimately pass to the most appropriate player.

That is why Valencia has had a better time fitting in this year; because he also dribbles face up, slower and calmly. He is not the best at any means but it's hard to find players built to an almost new innovation.

Shaw will no doubt get there.

3359~~~
err

5.7 Average rating


for a start...

3360~~~
<a class="username" data-user="96090, @Santiago_KinderBueno" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/96090/">@Santiago_KinderBueno</a> I say "progress towards the direction". so of course there was little consistency there yet. However, there were phases he showed the flashes there, and if I remember rightly the two times he was the most dangerous, he sent two passes on the ground, not whipping the crosses in, and the position was not from out wide but somewhere closer to the central areas?

3361~~~
I am a bit biased about that match because alot of people talked about him taking players on.  To me that is his natural game that he has to blend with his thus far his unnatural game.  Passing on the floor and dribbling forward instead of wide is something he has to perfect but if he did so on that match then I have to agree with you that it is an improvement. The easiest way I see his positioning is to view him as a LDM rather than a LB.  There is a reason blind is currently better than him but shaw under guidance from both blind &  van gaal could be legendary.

3362~~~
I forgot that the opinions of people on the internet who aren't famed for their objectivity was the best way to determine whether a player should be transferred. If only we had a system for rating opposition players to save the club scouting expenses.

3363~~~
I love it....when the season actually starts, people slate Valencia (rightly IMO) when they actually watch him play (do a search for 'Valencia' in the matchday forum)....then during the off-season it's back to rose-tinted-spectacles.

3364~~~
<a class="username" data-user="93689, @darioterios" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/93689/">@darioterios</a> 

The best way i would class shaw's performance is that he has yet to become a habitual player centrally like blind & like Mcnair. It's still second nature but i expect him to get things kicking on.  A very good move to withhold him from some of the tournaments too.

3365~~~
There we go confirmation that van gaal will use alot of youth in our international friendlies.  Mcnair at RB i presume.  

Though coleman is better than Clyne; i would have expected us to have gone for Clyne to blood him in.  The fact that we haven't probably stipulates van gaal deeming valencia as good enough and a team leader until someone like Mcnair can take his place.

3366~~~
You'd struggle to see me slate Valenia throughout the season. But then I don't make my mind up on how he's performed based on he is or before the game started. There's a mob mentality on here and people actively look for things to whine about. Referencing the match day forum is the worst thing you can do. It's full of cretins.

3367~~~
I think we've seen enough evidence in his games against us alone to see that he can defend and be part of a unit. Even this season we got no joy against him

3368~~~
A pretty poor unit if we look at more than two games.

3369~~~
yep that's true. The fans look to mob one our players based on...you know...just for the heck of it. Nothing about actual performances...that's just a coincidence. 

<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3370~~~
He had a very poor spell as a winger and people can't look past it and admit when he's played well. His worth is shown in the fact managers keep playing him. I'll take that above his average rating on Redcafe.

3371~~~
<a class="username" data-user="96090, @Santiago_KinderBueno" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/96090/">@Santiago_KinderBueno</a>

You make many interesting points about our full backs in van Gaal's current system. What really caught my eye is how they're supposed to be more central rather than wide in their attacking approach. It reminds me of the 1990's Ajax team under van Gaal who had centrally-oriented full backs in Reiziger and Frank de Boer with Rijkaard stepping up to support the attack and Davids + Seedorf drifting out to the channels to stretch teams and support Finidi and Overmars.

The thing about that Ajax setup, though is that it had a libero stepping up, two box-to-box midfielders, and one #10 in the midfield. This is a setup that van Gaal hasn't replicated since then. In the 21st century, van Gaal changed his system with inside wingers and wing backs becoming more prominent. With Bayern, we've seen him play a 4-2-3-1, regularly playing an attacking full back like Lahm on the right side and bringing up Contento in order to move back Badstuber to central defence. When van Gaal was playing the 4-2-3-1 with the Netherlands, he had two attacking full backs. With us, he played a back 3 and encouraged the wing backs to really bomb forward and provide the width, and he continued that on with our backwards-pointing 4-3-3 in which Blind and Valencia both overlapped the wide players.

This is not to say that he prefers attacking wing backs to play the full back roles. He has still set up his full backs such that his system is not compromised, and it's the most balanced approach that he's set up for his full backs (which further highlight's van Gaal's tactical nous and creativity). As you see in most teams nowadays, once they have the ball, the full backs push up to become wingers quite quickly. To support them, the central defenders push out wide, and the defensive midfielder drops back to make a back 3. Ahead of him are attacking midfielders/inverted wingers and one attacking midfielder and one box-to-box midfielder to supply the ball to, who will move the ball forward and supply players in the final third.

What van Gaal does, however, is completely different. He doesn't have his full backs push up with a defensive midfielder dropping back. He has his defensive midfielder remain ahead of his central defence whilst the full backs stay back. As you said, we aim to build up centrally through the central defenders and defensive midfielder, spreading out the team as we advance forward and utilising the wingers as a result. If we have a destroyer and box-to-box midfielder in a 4-2-3-1 (van Bommel-Schweini, de Jong-Strootman, or Schneidi-Herrera?), he will have the box-to-box midfielder carry the ball forward with the destroyer providing support in the build-up. If we go with a backwards-pointing 4-3-3 or the Ajax 4-3-3, he'll have the defensive midfielder/libero (Carrick or Rijkaard) dictate the build-up.

Full backs in van Gaal's setup are very important in the build up of attacks. They are key in helping the team maintain possession and move the ball forward through the middle. van Gaal doesn't want them to be adventurous wing backs and break the lines regularly like Alves, Zabaleta, Coleman, Alba, etc. He wants them to provide support to the central defenders and midfielders during the build-up. The full backs are key in overloading the wide areas and creating spaces through the middle. Such players are expected to be very good in retaining possession and playing midfielders into space in the middle. We saw this happen many times with McNair, Blind, and Valencia whilst Shaw is still adapting to this. Having said this, in adapting his system, van Gaal also wants his full backs to provide the width higher up the pitch when the wingers go inside. We saw this many times with Blind going forward to support Young, Rafael on the right when we played with the diamond, Valencia on the right when Mata drifted inside, and Shaw bombing forward from the left. It's not the first time he did this either; he did this before with Lahm and Contento at Bayern Munich, and Janmaat/van Rhijn and Willems for the Netherlands.

As a result, don't expect him to remain with his old-school approach; I'm sure that he won't mind using an attacking full back as long as he shows discipline in his approach and doesn't bomb forward/break the lines too soon.

Fantastic points. As you said the wide wing backs is not out the question but the important factor is fullbacks who can play through the middle. Full backs everywhere around the world play a similar approach as to not concern me about hitting the width's of the field because it is a fundamental aspects to the their game.  For most teams the fullbacks are normally used as 'ping-pong' players out widte where they are used to pass the ball and move on acclimatizing to the width that creates.

I agree with all your points but let's not forget that he has to adapt his system to suit the english game which is still heavily reliant on physicality & physicality is normally based in midfield not the wings. That is why if I had to disagree with you on one thing is that our full backs are supposed to attack centrally. In fact my view is that they have to defend centrally and attack in to space.


<a class="externalLink" href="http://sharemytactics.com/46412/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://sharemytactics.com/46412/Manchester-United-future-formation-tactics.png" src="http://sharemytactics.com/46412/Manchester-United-future-formation-tactics.png"/></a>

Firstly; Imagine Valencia on the right hand side hugging the touch line; he has at most the ability to pass to Herrera, Smalling, or Di Maria.
Now a centrally positioned Valencia can influence the game by having the possibility to pass to Smalling, Carrick, 2 box to box players, Rooney and also Di Maria. If we defend narrow it forces the opposition to acclimatize around the middle whenever we retain possesion.  One of our main problems last year was that teams would just wait and park the bus; this can be easily solved by forcing them to cover the areas we want them to be in; and if they park the bus through the middle, it will create more space on the wings for our full backs and wingers to manipulate.


Furthermore, if you view our fullbacks as Wide defensive midfielders then it becomes apparent why van gaal insists on Right footed CB's on the right and Left footed Cb's on the left.

For example, Hazard is attaking down the left, Valencia is the closest DM to him and follows him all the way until the ball stops rolling.  When Hazard has the ball on the left; there is absolute no reason for any of our defenders be that DM's or CB's to approach Hazard other than the one closest to him. Smalling the RCB becomes an inverted RB due to Valencia Man Marking Hazard, allowing Carrick space to fall back in to defence. That means we never lose shape. 

                         -Valencia (on Hazard)
Blind-Rojo-Carrick-Smalling

Likewise let's say Willian has the ball on the Right, Carrick or Valencia really should not be bothered because that is Blind's duty as he is the nearest defensive midfielder. Rojo Covers for him as an inverted LB, Carrick drops in to defence & again we dont lose shape.

3373~~~
To be fair, that's a whole point higher than your average team rating.

3374~~~
Louis van Gaal isn't planning on signing McNair from the market, he is looking to promote youth. There is a difference between scouting a player and watching him train, the manager's record with young players is actually very good.

And also

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.co.uk/story/887670/louis-van-gaal-declares-neuer-interest" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.co.uk/story/887670/louis-van-gaal-declares-neuer-interest</a>

Whether he did or did not want Neuer I don't know, things were complicated politically when Louis van Gaal promoted Kraft to first choice because they were going to sign Neuer from bundesliga rivals Schalke and some fans were unhappy with that initially. I don't think it was ever a case of Louis van Gaal thinking Neuer wasn't good enough.

3375~~~
And I suppose Berbatov was better than Tevez thats why we bought the former and replaced latter in the lineup, despite all the evidence that says otherwise in the coming years

3376~~~
Is this the same Berbatov that Fergie had no hesitation dropping for most of his last season at United?

With Valencia it's not even just one manager who's had a soft spot for him. Three different managers have consistently picked him ahead of caf favourites but redcafe knows best, right?

3377~~~
By one manager. If three had done likewise then the comparison may be worth something. As it was comparing a player we owned against one on loan seems beyond pointless.

3378~~~
Multiple managers used Gerrard and Lampard together in midfield

3379~~~
They did. Most being afraid not to for the media reaction most likely. Is there a similar reason for these different managers picking Valencia regularly?

3380~~~
For Moyes, probably. Sir Alex did it

3381~~~
So the other two?

3382~~~
They made a mistake like everyone else?

Sir Alex also used Park in CM among other things, I dont think we can pretend managers never get it wrong

3383~~~
We can't but when three successive managers continually pick a player it's fair to assume that there's a reason for it.

3384~~~
LvG hasn't had much of a choice so far

3385~~~
Could easily have tried to replace him last summer. Or played Rafael when he was fit. Or play McNair if he was as bad as people make out.

3386~~~
His intention was to play Rafael and have Tony V as a backup in the summer, it seems. A 19 year old centre back isnt really a viable choice.

3387~~~
The last I checked the calendar we were in 2015

3388~~~
Valencia is physically a beast, he's rarely injured and I suspect he consistently performs well statistically too. That combination will see you get picked regularly by most PL managers, I'd have thought.

3389~~~
IMO valencia is playing RB as the best RB at the club,period.  Rafael is the best RB at the club if we had any other manager in charge; however how strict instructions are followed are the epitome of van gaals approach to management. 

IMO,  van gaal is grooming Mcnair up to be our long term RB and as such the only RB to ever provide the stability and instructional techniques was dani alves. 

People think that fullbacks can only be one type of player; pace,  crossing ability etc.

If ivanovic can play RB for the best club in england last year then i dont see why Mcnair could not play there. 

Mcnair is a CB/CDM.  How many times have we seen Mcnair dribble from CB all the way up to midfield?

Thats not what central defenders do and this type of attacking qualities can be utilised in a full back position.  The problem is alot of our fans expect to see fullbacks who hug the touchline but how exactly is that possible when we play so narrow in the first place?

3390~~~
Rafael was available for a decent chunk of last season but remained behind Valencia in the pecking order. Jones could have been picked ahead of him too. But wasn't. Van Gaal wasn't 'forced' to pick Valencia at all.

3391~~~
Yeah, but it is not as if we have been breath taking in those seasons. We won the title once, finished fourth and finished 7th. Not blaming it only on Valencia but that is hardly a glowing recommendation. So the managers have been doing something wrong the last two seasons that we have been this abysmal.

3392~~~
Of course but it still points to a player who obviously is capable of doing something right. Which if you were to believe some of the posts in here would be hard to fathom.

3393~~~
I doubt anyone believes that a professional international footballer cannot do anything right. Many people are simply pointing out that he is not good enough for the club, which is not outrageous by any count. Just because managers play him does not make him a good enough player for us, considering where we have finished those seasons.

3394~~~
Um... You know we won the league when a hell of lot of people on here were pissing and moaning about Valencia holding onto the right wing slot? If you're going to use the logic of league position reflecting individual contributions it also works against you.

Basically, Valencia has constantly been picked in our best XI ever since he joined the club. Under three different managers. Including some extremely succesful seasons. But he's "not good enough for the club". Gotcha...

3395~~~
Jones is shit at RB (and we weren't exactly spoilt for choice at CB either). As uncomfortable as I am with Tony V there on a regular basis I prefer him to Jones. I think with Rafael he'd decided he's too injury prone to bother with.  Put it this way- I dont rate Valencia as a RB at all but I'd have played hi there last season if I was lvg.

3396~~~
You don't not play an injury prone player if he isn't actually injured and is better than the player currently playing his position, just because he's injury prone. At least that's not anything I can remember any manager ever doing before. It would be madness.

3397~~~
Didn't wanna risk throwing a player back on after a lengthy layoff probably. It's also worth considering that he wanted minimal disruption to the starting lineup - especially as Rafael would likely end up crocked a few weeks after coming back in. I don't believe that van Gaal genuinely sees Valencia as a better right back than Rafael, more that he made his mind up that Rafael had to go after his umpteenth injury.

3398~~~
Yeah Pogue, because players can never deteriorate and are always playing like they used to. Valencia started off as a winger for us. He has been so diabolical there for a good three years that he has been converted to a RB now. He does a decent job there and I will be the first to admit it, but I merely pointed out our league positions because many people keep drumming about him being selected continuously. We have ranged from decent to atrocious these last two seasons when he has been god awful. I never claimed he was not a very good winger in his prime (which is what you are pointing out when you say he has been part of successful seasons) but he has gone massively downhill since and as things stand he is not good enough for a starting position in our team if we want to reach the heights of earlier.

3399~~~
Valencia had been tremendous until everyone started to understand his trick (ie go deep and cross the ball). Afterwards he became less and less effective. TBF He's the worst right winger SAF had ever had

3400~~~
Valencia has basically played as RWB since the start of last season. Initially in a 5-3-2 and then in a 4-3-3 behind Mata. He's the only player we have who can do it. Rafael is too lightweight. Hell, if Di Maria needs to be replaced by Fellaini as a central midfielder in the PL, so does Rafa as a RWB.

Valencia is a player who can build up the right on his own by shielding the ball with his (sizeable) body, whereas Rafael is more of a give-and-go passer of the ball. That's the difference between the two. Unless LvG can find another right back who can run the flank without support, expect to see Valencia starting next season as our first choice.

To be fair, Coleman probably can.

3401~~~
Yep. Near ipossible to run faster than and near impossible to bully off the ball. Other than Zaha, I can't think of many wingers who gave him the run around (and even Ivanovic had problems against Palace).

3402~~~
That's like saying "count me out of this discussion because I cannot be objective about this". 

Valencia's a good squad player. He's a tryer. Has some solid games, some games that even surprise you and make you go "well that's quite good actually", and in between a good bunch of them that make you wonder how he's there in the first place. I exaggerate but yeah he's not the standard of right back for a club like Manchester United. Some might say he isn't even a right back given the way he can completely switch off into dreams of his majestic winger days while not actually playing there. But I'd keep him, as long as it's <i>just</i> not him, because just Valencia, isn't really good enough.

3403~~~
He was never picked as a RB under SAF, the pecknig order was Rafael > Jones/Smalling > Val/Fletcher.

It started under Moyes as a trend to sub Rafael off and send Valencia back and almost every time we did that we both played worse going forward and also conceded many more chances. 
LvG has consistently picked Valencia at RB. I'm not very sure about his reading of defenders (I remember Badstuber, ironically, against Valencia, and Nani derstroying Lahm from the other side while a half-fit Rooney could keep their CBs off balance)


For SAF and Moyes, Val > Nani; for LvG, Val > Rafael.
For what it's worth, I think both decisions are wrong.

3404~~~
Whatever position he played, he's been in the starting XI when fit for almost every single game of his United career. Not something you can say about many of our squad over that time. A period that included a number of trophies. Yet he's the one being singled out in this thread as "not good enough for United". Go figure.

3405~~~
Of course he's good enough Pogue but the haters are going to hate! There are things Valencia can improve on no doubt but I've yet to see him being torn apart by anyone at full back. Plus he is a better and more reliable option than Rafael imo who switched of constantly whilst defending the back post. If we are going to replace him then the guy coming in will have to be top class or Valencia will just reclaim the jersey. If he ups his crossing levels and confidence is high he is a great asset to any team.

3406~~~
Personally, I prefer him at RB ahead of the so called prem defenders people are raving about *cough* Clyne and Coleman.

3407~~~
I've read your earlier posts and have seen your diagrams and I really don't know where you are getting this from? It may have some validity on the left with Young hugging the touch line but with Mata playing ahead of him, Valencia provides the only width on the right for United. He plays higher and wider than a regular full back.

Valencia's main strength in that position is his ability to retain possession and I agree with you that he follows instructions better than Rafael as he isn't as instinctive a player. I think you're overthinking this "playing centrally" thing though. Rafael is a better central midfielder than Pogba after all!

In the middle third of the pitch Valencia is fine but his end product and (far more importantly) his defensive instincts are dreadful. United play a possession game and are generally quite low scoring. Playing that way makes the first goal vitally important and you just cannot have a defender as poor as Valencia.

3408~~~
I rate him higher than Clyne (who I think is just steady and no better than Phil Bardsley) but Coleman is around the same level and better end product but Tony is better defensively.

3409~~~
That rules out Rafael and also Alves plus if I recall Evra did more than ok for us. If our full back is offering enough going forward we will find a way to cover him defensively.

3410~~~
Absolutely. And perhaps their reason was flawed, just like anyone's else reasoning could be

3411~~~
If you can try find it; look for the post match analysis after the win agaisnt liverpool or city.

Neville talks about how centrally orientated our defenders are. 

As of right now,  mata is probably the best RW/RF we have.  Van gaal knows this and plays herrera and valencia more to the right hand touchline to counter the fact that mata drifts in as an AM instead of a CF.  That gives even rafael the ability to be a great squad player.

IMO thats why I doubt we will go for a new RB because buying one like coleman who hugs the touchline will mean that mata is the future of our RW; in reality he is a stop gap solution until we find a forward like depay who can cut in and shoot.

Having a forward who hugs the touchline and gets in to forward positions,  means that our RB should start centrally and drift out to the wide as our forward cuts in; no earlier or no later.

3412~~~
It's also not a coincidence that his crap form for the last three years, and him being our outlet ball, has coincided with our worst, slowest and most turgid football over this time too.

3413~~~
Slow football is not bad football.  The best team of the last 10 years or even ever have played slower football than us.  We have to build up from somewhere &  getting a fast full action fullback like coleman only to tell him to slow himself down makes absolute no sense. I am sure van gaal has a RB in mind and valencia is only there as the most suitable stop gap until our boy Mcnair is ready.

3414~~~
You're seriously blaming one player for that? Christ.

3415~~~
The football we played in 12/13, 13/14 and last season has on the whole been awful. We got away with it by being lethal and having a strong winning mentality in 12/13 (and RVP genius), but the last couple of seasons our issues have been going forward and scoring goals. Valencia doesn't help because he gets the single most space in our team and doesn't do anything with it. He will get the ball with his fullback isolated and he will take an hour to decide what to do with it. If he's shown inside then he will do everything in his power to not go inside, or will play some cowardly pass back, or will try and go on the outside anyway and knock in some percentage ball (hence the shin breaking crosses). He takes no responsibility and it means that we just get stifled in attack.

Let's be clear here, there's a reason he didn't get a look to actually play on the wing this year. This is a man who was our player of the year, and our fecking number 7. Yet he's meant to be immune from criticism despite now being a bootleg right back.

Where did I say it was all Valencia's fault? It's clear that a big feature of our play in the last three years has been Valencia receiving the ball in acres of space and doing something that leads to our attacks breaking down and slowing down. Valencia on form was a key feature of our attacking play in the past, so obviously when he plays like he does now it's a big drag on our football.

3416~~~
All 3 mentioned are significantly better defensively than Valencia. 90% of being a good full back defensively is positioning and being able to anticipate danger. I really cannot see how anyone can watch Valencia play at right back and think he can do either of those things to an acceptable level. He's a good squad player but simply cannot be a starter.


The first City goal came from Valencia allowing a runner inside him so not sure the defence was as narrow as you suggest. He did the same vs Chelsea.

I think the complete opposite. United's centre backs (Smalling on the right in particular) get dragged wider than I've seen under any other manager. Often Carrick is the deepest central player. Not sure if that is through accident or design.

I think there is no doubt United will sign a right back. I am very doubtful that Coleman will be the player. I think the player will be more technically sound than explosive. Valencia does part of the role Van Gaal wants exceptionally well but if he doesn't want a better player defensively I would be very concerned.

3417~~~
Thats why i assume Mcnair will be RB atleast in our summer tours away.  You statr thst we need a RB who is better defensively than valencia.  There is no doubt that Mcnair is better.  Attacking wise both valencia and Mcnair are quite shyte but i am sure that van gaal would prefer defenders to play with intelligence than explosive wing back play.

3418~~~
I can't remember which game it was but McNair had one game where he was disastrous defensively. I think it was a league game just after he had a great game there in the cup (Cambridge?).

Being good defensively at full back is all about knowing the position. I don't think either Valencia or McNair are first choice options there short term. I haven't seen a lot of Darmian but he looks like the right type of player.

3419~~~
It was against southampton man.  He was awful that game but that kind of performances are expected from him no matter where he plays.  My view of the fullback spots are like defensive midfielders  one on the right and onenon the left.  It might show why currently and currently only that blind is our no1 LB due to his natural positioning as a LDM and why van gaal was quoted as saying Mcnair could be our RB (since mcnair has natural RDM qualities).

3420~~~
He's good enough to do a job at RB and unless we bring in a really top one which I'm struggling to think of who's available who would be an upgrade in all fairness plus I don't want to see us spending £25m-30m on a RB. There's not even a young RB coming through who we can buy early for a high price like Shaw.

With Valencia, he's strong and fast. No-one is going to stand him up and beat him in a 1-1, and he puts a shift in going forward and retains possession. I have no problem seeing him at RB and I feel he may get better this season. His problem occurs with runs in behind and over his shoulder, full-backs always need to be on their toes and checking over their shoulder to see if wingers are running in behind them which happened frequently to Valencia where he would switch off and let it happen. Instinctively as a winger, it's easy to understand as normally the man would be passed onto the full-back or a recovery run would be made but at RB, you need to match the runner in behind to prevent the danger.

3421~~~
Not the Southampton one. He was right centre back in a 3 in that game. I looked it up. Burnley at home was the game I meant.

I actually agree with your point that Van Gaal wants a player who retains the ball at full back rather than a great dribbler but we'll have to agree to disagree on this RDM/LDM stuff. They just don't play there or anywhere close.

3422~~~
Not really. Because you'll also struggle to see me say he's been amazing either. I think he'd a decent enough season. Some good games and some bad ones. I just don't feel the need to join in the ridiculous abuse he gets on here when he does have a bad game.

3423~~~
And perhaps it wasn't. It's a hell of a coincidence that three in a row rated him a lot higher than the people on here.

3424~~~
Falling for the same trap

3425~~~
That being what? You aren't providing any compelling argument for why he continues to play if he is bad. The fact you can't acknowledge there may be a good reason for this shows your open mindedness.

3426~~~
That's one of the reasons why i hate graphs, they show a static picture when in reality the players' defensive positioning is a result of many different factors, i.e. which player concedes possession and where and whether the opposition team is using one of the flanks to build up an attacking play or going through the middle. I believe he meant that our general plan is to always have three defenders in the box but i may be wrong.

You are completely right about the bold part. In the final third of the season, during which we started using the 4-3-3 as our main formation, it was one of the CBs who was moving into the wide areas to close down the first attacker. Then Carrick (or Blind) was dropping deeper to cover for the CB and our FB on the opposite side was moving into the box and nearer to the other CB. So, we had three defenders in the box plus one marking the first attacker, these are the four defensive players LvG desires according to NLMax and other Dutch posters.

I don't believe it was coincidence. There has been a lot of discussion about LvG implementing his philosophy into the first team but we sometimes forget that LvG had to adjust his methods and his preferred style of play to the particularities of the English football too. We must not forget that we struggled in the beginning of the season against sides like Burnley, Leicester, Big Sam's West Ham etc., sides which didn't possess much quality on the ball but they were loaded with pace, strength and incredible energy levels.

Too often we saw players get on the ball in their half and then attempting dynamic runs which cut through our midfield like knife cuts through butter. I believe it was one of LvG's primary concerns, one of the main reasons he started experimenting with different formations and one of the reasons the players seemed so afraid to move in more advanced positions but kept possession in our half instead. The first time we saw this tactic (one CB closing down the first attacker) was in the second half of the away game against QPR. It was mostly Jones who was moving out of position, sometimes in the midfield, to slow down the opposition's attack and give the rest time to get behind the ball. LvG decided to stick with it and it actually paid off.

In that particular tactic the two full backs are indeed in more central positions. The one, as i mentioned earlier, moves in the box to operate as a third CB while the other protects the channel between the (wide) CB and the holding midfielder (who's dropped deeper) with the instruction to track any attacker who attempts a late run in the box or to anticipate a clearance from the defenders and pick up the second balls in between our lines.

A more defensive minded player like McNair might do the job but i'm with you when you say that we could use a more technically gifted RB than Valencia. As you mentioned, it doesn't have to be a dynamic FB, like Coleman, who will always look for the opportunity to do an overlap. If that was the case Rafael would have gotten more playing time. I believe we're looking for a player who will be tactically adequate and play his part in our build up play but also provide some end product in the final third. The fact that none of our FBs could be a threat in the final third was one of the reasons we struggled to create chances last season

3427~~~
What are you even talking about?  Are you even following our conversation?

My point was that 3 managers in a row can make a mistake. That 3 managers picking him doesn't automatically mean its not a questionable choice to use him

At no point has it been on me to provide proof that it is definitely beyond reasonable doubt a mistake to pick him. But its pretty obvious to most people that he's been one of the weakest points of the team for many years in a row. Maybe not the weakest and worst, but somewhere close.

3428~~~
And the point is maybe there is a good reason. You haven't even acknowledged the possibility.

3429~~~
2 PL titles in quite a weak field, neither of which had anything to with him (he missed almost the full 2010/11 season and was terrible during 2012/13), one run to the CL final where he played really well in the quarters and semis, and 1 League Cup which honestly I can't remember (I think he had an assist in the final.)
He definitely was not the standout player for any of the wins while Nani who he replaced was POTY in 10/11 while Rafael in 12/13 was 3rd behind RvP and Carrick. Which is why it grates so much to see him become regarded as so obviously superior to those 2.


On a side note, the only other regular constant between the 2 titles would be Carrick, Vidic, and Evra. Rafael and Rooney were not regulars for most of the 2010/11 season, and Rio and Nani for the 12/13 season, Carrick's partner changed quite a lot too, Berbatov, Hernandez and RvP all played at different times, Park was crucial only in 10/11, VDS replaced by DDG, Jones, Kagawa and Young brought in after the 1st win..
I guess that squad was being refreshed, a shame that Moyes couldn't take it forward.

3430~~~
Clearly abuse and criticism are too different things.

"Go feck yourself, Toni" - abuse
"Valencia is playing poorly" - criticism

3431~~~
There's been more of the ilk of the former than the latter.

3432~~~
He has made much less mistakes over the season in comparison with most full backs. Coleman gets all his praises for his attacking skill but defensively he is weak. Clyne isn't even that good attacking wise. Even zabaleta had a poor season. Bellerin for instance was taken to the cleaners by Young but Valencia held Sanchez really well. His main mistakes were against arsenal and Everton . Even in the Everton game only the stones goal could be said as his mistake . The hate for him is unwarranted here.

3433~~~
This thread <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3434~~~
Don't expect it to change. Valencia is not a popular player at all

But I agree, I think Valencia was one of the best fullbacks in the league last season. Although he did have one or two high profile blunders

3435~~~
I'm not in disagreement he had a good season or that he's a good player. Good should mean squad player at Man United, I don't think that's unreasonable. People can be quite annoying and irrational with that line of thinking, you see people make silly statement like Smalling isnt good enough for United because he's not Vidic, that we also need to have a bench full of world class players, and other such silliness, that isnt what I'm saying. If people are saying we should sell him then I don't agree at all.

What i also don't agree with is the idea that he must be good enough to be a regular fixture in the team merely BECAUSE he's been a regular feature in the team. Cleverley was a starter under two managers. England managers have picked mediocre players like Parker and Barry over Carrick. And anyway in Tony V's case, I'm talking about him a first choice right back - van Gaal is the only one to start him their regularly and I've already said why I think that was. Admittedly he is very hard to beat in one on ones, its getting caught out of position and poor marking that are the problem there, and its well documented his crossing ability has fallen off a cliff. You can say there aren't many top right backs available out there for sure but that doesn't mean Valencia is of the required standard to be starting there for us.

3436~~~
Good post. I agree completely with this. Not sure why some people get so defensive over the criticism of Valencia. Yes he's hard working and has been loyal, but when we can do better then we should do better. I would definitely keep him as back up though. No issues there at all. Especially with his ability to be used in multiple positions, though I actually prefer him at right back.

3437~~~
The criteria that IMO seem important for a RB in this system are 1) Positioning 2) Retaining possession 3) Crossing and there just aren't any players out there that fit these days with the abundance of "modern" fullbacks.  The only ones I can think of that best fit that criteria are Lahm, Dani Alves, and then possibly Ivanovic and Zabaleta and none of them are available to us.  IMO the ideal player would be Gary Neville. 

Valencia's physical capabilities smooth over many of his positioning issues and he may improve his positioning, he is excellent at retaining possession, but his crossing can be comical at times.  I think we can do better at RB, but I won't be surprised if we simply sign someone to cover for him so that we can move Rafael on.

3438~~~
I don't believe that van Gaal set it up so that the full backs actually just push up and go into the midfield positions. I believe that this is more down to circumstance than anything else. What I mean by this is that players just fill in for others and, essentially, take up different positions to retain the shape. This is something that's reminiscent of total football where players are able to defend in any area as well. I'll go into detail on this in the next paragraph.

Whenever an opposing winger, attacking midfielder, or wide central midfielder goes out wide in the middle third, Valencia (I'll be referring to him since this is a thread about him) pushes up to immediately press the ball holder out wide and unsettle him. This is down to instruction in order to prevent the wide player from taking the ball and running at our defence and disorganising it. When Valencia pushes up, someone has to take up the right back slot, so Smalling goes there. Someone has to take the central defence slot at the right side, so Carrick/Blind goes there. Since the defensive midfield slot is vacant, Valencia normally drifts into that role whilst Herrera continues to play his usual #8 role. Since the ball's at the right side, the whole team automatically shifts in towards the right to maintain a compact shape (left central defender goes to the middle of the box whilst the left full back goes to the far post; the defensive midfielder at the right side of the defence is normally just beyond the far post to cover for a run into that area).

As you can see, the final positions of the players is a part of his total football philosophy and not something special that he planned out. The issue that we faced earlier, and the reason why van Gaal tried to set us up so that we had 4 players in defence, is that players were moving into areas in between the players' positions, and this caused issues with the players early on as no one took charge of closing down the ball-holder by straying out of their area. This was a real problem for us against teams that played the long-ball game and/or had willing runners in the attacking roles (Vardy, Ings, Sakho, Walters, etc.). van Gaal remedied this by giving certain players the responsibility to close down the ball-holders in those in-between areas, which we saw with Jones/left back on the left and Valencia on the right, and as a result, our whole shape and defensive structure improved; this was because other defenders knew that they wouldn't be the ones challenging for the ball and, instead, holding the shape.

Other than this, though, we'd maintain our usual back 4 shape in the 4-3-3 with Valencia out on the right side in our third marking the opposing wide player. Him being so tough to get past due to his pace and strength made him very useful. Also, his technique and physical traits on the right side allowed us to maintain possession and create spaces in the middle as players would look to close him down. Where he really falls off, though, is his deliveries from the right. If we had a proper right winger instead of Mata, this wouldn't be too much of an issue. However, as seen last season, Valencia cannot be a consistent danger on the right if we play someone like Mata there.

The fact is; if there was someone better than valencia then everybody would be on it for a signing. 

The problem is that when people attack valencia it is normally to encourage a signing of an almost similar player.  Thats what makes me defend valencia. 

When Alves was available,  i was keen for that signing no matter the guys age because he is hands down &  without question a better RB than valencia will ever be. 

However the flavour of the month be that Clyne (which i rightfully guessed as a non signing),  or Coleman even darmian who will have to be 1/100 to be a successful italian in the premiership; is neither realistic or needed.  
. 12-15 or 20 million is a hell of a lot of money to spend on a minor improvement especially when we have gaps across our squad.

You're overrating Valencia. He has big glaring weaknesses in his ability to spot danger and position himself. I'm pretty confident we'll sign a natural right back and not have half the chaos down the right hand side we've had (see goals scored down that flank through gaping holes e.g. Chelsea away, arsenal in the Fa cup, City at home, Everton away and Smalling getting sent off covering that channel City away). Those guys mentioned may not be the next Cafu, but they're a lot better RBs that Valencia.

3441~~~
so assuming we sign darmian, what does this mean for valencia?

surely, SURELY there's no way he'll play as a winger again. i'd like to think that he'll then be RB backup, as rafa will be out.

3442~~~
That's exactly what will happen I think. Valencia's 30 next month and so as long as he gets decent minutes he'll most likely want to stick around for a few years yet. Only thing that may change his mind is if his place in the national team comes into question.

Rafael is out favour with van Gaal and I expect him to be sold.

In the beginning of the season, probably nothing. I can't claim that i've watched many of Torino's games in the Serie A but i don't think that there's something that suggests Darmian will be a regular starter from day one. To me he seems more or less like a utility player. He can play on both flanks, in fact he played as a (defensive)<span style="text-decoration: underline"> left </span>wing back more than anything else at Torino, plus his height and strength allow him to be a choice in the center half position too.

Probably a better defender than Valencia, tactically inept (as any Italian footballer who gets called in the NT) with and without the ball which is something that LvG rates highly but not as pacey as Valencia and with zero experience at a top club which doesn't defend with 8 or more players behind the ball. We'll have to wait and see if he's going to prove himself significantly better than Valencia on the pitch.

Right now, he seems like a rather cheap but clever signing who will start his United career as a back up for both Valencia and Shaw. Until we get the chance to watch him on the pitch the only "safe" conclusion we can draw is LvG's intention to have enough options at both FBs positions so he won't have to Smalling, Jones or even Rojo and Blind there.

3444~~~
I doubt if we've bought (hopefully) the best right back in Serie A (who was also voted best player on the Italian NT) with the intention that he should be a backup. And, as a point of information, he played more games as right wing back than left last season (Torino play 3 at the back, so they play wing backs rather than full backs.)

3445~~~
If you have watched him play a lot, i'll gladly take your word for him. He started in RWB in Europe but in the Serie A Perez was Torino's first choice in that position and Darmian shared the LWB role with Molinaro and got some games (8 or 9) at RWB. Which, by all means, is a good thing for us. 

I believe Lichtsteiner is still the best RB/RWB in Serie A. If we take him out of the equation, being the best among players like Basta, Tomovic, Maicon, Maggio, Silvestri and Torosidis doesn't really say that much to me. As i said i haven't watched him play much.

I'm willing to trust LvG's judgement on the matter but, as things stand, i want to watch him play for us on the pitch before i say that he's a definite upgrade on Valencia. At this point i'm just glad we didn't go for van der Wiel.

A truly average player.

I had to Google that, I'm also glad we didn't sign a pornstar at rightback <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I also didn't get the "joke", if there is one...
